XXXAuthorship Information
!!!COM: Composer's name. In some cases, opinions differ regarding the best spelling of a composer's name. If so, all common spellings should be given -- each alternative separated from the previous by a semicolon. E.g.
x!!COM: Chopin, Fryderyk; Chopin, Frederick
With respect to accents, refer to the discussion concerning the !!RLN: reference record (see below). If a work was composed by more than one composer, then each composer's name should appear on a separate !!COM: record with a number designation prior to the colon. For example,
x!!COM1: Composer, A. 
x!!COM2: Composer, B.
!!!COA: Attributed composer. This may include attributions known to be false. Several attributions may be combined on a single record by separating each name by a semicolon. Note that if a document contains both !!COA: and !!COM: records, then the attributed composer is explicitly assumed to be false.
!!!COS: Suspected composer. This reference code indicates the belief of the editor or producer of the document as to the true identity of the composer(s). If more than one composer is suspected, each name should appear on a separate !!COS: record with a number designation prior to the colon.
!!!COL: Composer's abbreviated, alias, or stage name. e.g. Madonna.
!!!COC: Composer(s) corporate name. Corporate names may include the names of popular groups (especially when the actual composer is not known). Corporate names may also include business names, e.g. Muzak.
!!!CDT: Composer's dates. The birth and death dates should be encoded using the **Zeit format described in the Humdrum Reference Manual. The **Zeit format provides a highly refined representation, including methods for representing uncertainty, approximation, and boundary dates (e.g. prior to ..., after ...).
!!!CNT: Nationality of the composer. This reference information is encoded using the language of the nationality. Thus a German composer is encoded as Deutscher rather than "German", and a French composer is encoded as Francais rather than "French." Of course the specific language can be explicitly encoded using the 3-letter language codes described above. (e.g., !!CNT@@FRE: Francais). Where the composer changed nationality, successive nationalities should be listed (in chronological order) separated by semicolons.
!!!LYR: Lyricist. The name of the lyricist. If more than one lyricist was involved in the work, then each lyricist's name should appear on a separate !!LYR: record with a number designation prior to the colon. If the composer was also the lyricist, this should be explicitly encoding using the independent !!LYR: record -- rather than implicitly assumed.
!!!LIB: Librettist. The name of the librettist. If more than one librettist was involved in the work, then each librettist's name should appear on a separate !!LIB: record with a number designation prior to the colon. If the composer was also the librettist, this should be explicitly encoding using the independent !!LIB: record -- rather than implicitly assumed.
!!!LAR: Arranger. The name of the arranger. If more than one arranger was involved in the work, then each arranger's name should appear on a separate !!LAR: record with a number designation prior to the colon.
!!!LOR: Orchestrator. The name of the orchestrator. If more than one orchestrator was involved in the work, then each orchestrator's name should appear on a separate !!LOR: record with a number designation prior to the colon.
!!!TXO: Original language of vocal/choral text. The name of the language should be encoded in that language. For example, russki rather than Russian.
!!!TXL: Language of the encoded vocal/choral text. The name of the language should be encoded in the language used for encoding. For example, Italiano rather than Italian.
!!!TRN: Translator of text. The name of the translator of any vocal, choral, or dramatic text. If more than one translator was involved in the work, then each translator's name should appear on a separate !!TRN: record with a number designation prior to the colon.

Location designations are encoded using latitude and longitude values -- suitable for creating maps. The first numerical value indicates latitude (positive values indicating North, negative values indicating South). The second numerical value indicates longitude (positive values only, indicating distance East from the central meridian). A slash separates the latitude and longitude values. A series of trailing characters is used to indicate the degree of accuracy of the location information: % (continent), @ (country), # (province or state), : (town or village). For large regions such as countries or provinces, the geographical center of the region is used.

!!!RLN: ASCII language setting. This reference identifies the "language" code in which the file was encoded. This is applicable only to computer platforms which provide "extended ASCII" text capabilities (e.g. Danish or Spanish characters).
!!!RDF: User-defined signifiers. All Humdrum representations provide some signifiers (ASCII characters) that remain undefined. Users are free to use these undefined signifiers as they choose. When undefined signifiers appear in a given document, the !!RDF**interp: code should be used to specify what the signifiers denote. Notice that the code RDF is followed by the name of the interpretation to which the signifier definition applies. In the following example, the letters "X" and "x" symbols that are defined within a hypothetical **piano representation. E.g.
x!!RDF**piano: X=hands cross, left over right 
x!!RDF**piano: x=hands cross, right over left
!!!RDT: Date encoded. This reference uses the Humdrum **date format to identify the date(s) when the document was encoded.
!!!RNB: Representation note. This reference provides a free-format text that conveys some document-specific note related to matters of representation.
!!!RWG: Representation warning. This reference may be used to encode explicit warnings concerning the encoded material.
