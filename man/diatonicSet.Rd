Modes are sorted secondarily from fewest flats to most sharps.
If \code{parallel = TRUE} all modes are grouped by shared tonics, so
C minor and C major will appear besides each other.
If \code{parallel = FALSE} modes/keys are sorted together by number of accidentals,
so C minor and Eb major will be sorted next to each other.}
