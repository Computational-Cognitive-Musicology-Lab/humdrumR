\arguments{
\item{humdrumR}{\emph{\strong{HumdrumR data to write.}}

Must be a \link[=humdrumRclass]{humdrumR data object}.}

\item{prefix}{\emph{\strong{A prefix to add to output filenames.}}

Defaults to \code{"humdrumR_"}.

Must be a single \code{character} string.}

\item{renamer}{\emph{\strong{A \code{function} to modify output filenames.}}

Defaults to \code{force} (keep the original filenames).

Must be a \code{function} which accepts a \code{character} vector and returns a new \code{charater} vector
of the same length.}

\item{affix}{\emph{\strong{An affix to add to output filenames.}}

Defaults to \code{""}.

Must be a single \code{character} string.

Affix is appended at end of filename, but before the extension.}

\item{extension}{\emph{\strong{What extension to use for new files.}}

Defaults to \code{NULL}, which means the file extension of the original files is used.

Must be \code{NULL}, or a single, non-empty \code{character} string.}

\item{directory}{\emph{\strong{A directory to write the files into.}}

Defaults to \code{NULL}.

Must be a single \code{character} string.

If \code{NULL}, files are written to the same directory (or directories) they were \link[=readHumdrum]{read from}.}

\item{overwrite}{\emph{\strong{Whether to overite existing files.}}

Defaults to \code{FALSE}.

Must be a singleton \code{logical} value: an on/off switch.

If \code{FALSE}, \code{writeHumdrum} will refuse to overwrite
any files. If \code{TRUE}, \code{writeHumdrum} will overwrite files, but only after an additional prompt from the user.}

\item{verbose}{\emph{\strong{Whether to show file names while writing.}}

Defaults to \code{FALSE}.

Must be a singleton \code{logical} value: an on/off switch.

If \code{TRUE}, each \emph{new} output file name is printed on the console
as the writing happens.}

\item{EMD}{\emph{\strong{A string to write to a new \verb{!!!EMD:} record in each file.}}

Defaults to "Editing in humdrumR, version X.X.X.XXX, on current data/time."

Must be a single \code{character} string.

If \code{NULL}, not appended.}

\description{
\code{writeHumdrum} writes \code{humdrumR} data into humdrum-syntax text files.
The current \link[=selectedFields]{selected field(s)} are evaluated to generate the humdrum output
data.
The written output should match the printout if printing the data in the \code{R} terminal.

\section{File names}{


The main option to control with \code{writeHumdrum} is what files to write to.
\code{writeHumdrum} uses the original names of the files, as \link[=readHumdrum]{read by readHumdrum},
as the basis for \emph{new} file names.
By default, \code{writeHumdrum} will refuse to overwrite the original files---overwriting
will only be allowed if you specify \code{overwrite == TRUE} \emph{and} respond with \code{"y"} to a prompt.

\code{writeHumdrum} generates \emph{new} file names by modifying the original read file names.
The \code{renamer} argument must be a function which takes the original names as an input \code{character} vector
(excluding the directory path and the file extension)
and returns a new \code{character} vector of the same length (the default is \code{R}'s identity function \code{force}).
After running \code{renamer}, the \code{character}-string \code{affix} and \code{prefix} arguments
are appended/prepended to the renamed names.
(The \code{affix} is affixed \emph{before} the extension.)
Finally, the \code{extension} argument can be used to specify a different file extension.

If any files in your data set contain multiple pieces, you can either write these
pieces into the same files (\code{seperateFiles = FALSE}), as they were originally, or write each piece into its
own new file (\code{separateFiles = TRUE}); if writing pieces into separate files,
each piece's file name is appended with \verb{_pieceN}, where \code{N} is the number of the piece within the file.

The \code{directory} argument indicates a file path where to write the files.
If the \code{directory} doesn't exist, it is created.
If \code{directory} is \code{NULL}, files are written to their original input directory (or directories).

The \code{EMD} argument specifies a character string to put into a new \code{!!!EMD} reference record
at the end of each file.
\code{EMD} records keep track of modifications to humdrum data.
The default behavior is to print a string indicating the \code{humdrumR} version number and date.
If \code{EMD} is set to \code{NULL}, it is not appended to the files.
