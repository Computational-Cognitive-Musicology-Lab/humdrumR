Defaults to \code{"humdrumR_"}.

Must be \code{character}; must be length \code{1}.}

\item{renamer}{\emph{\strong{A \code{function} for change the type of \code{Filename} field.}}

Defaults to \code{force}.

Must be \code{function}. Must accept a \code{character} vector and return a new \code{atomic} vector
of the same length.}

\item{affix}{\emph{\strong{A \code{character} string appended to the file name (before the extension).}}

Defaults to \code{""}.

Must be \code{character}; must be length \code{1}.}

\item{directory}{***A directory to write the files into. ***

Defaults to \code{NULL}.

Must be \code{character}; must be length \code{1}.

If \code{NULL}, files are written to the same directory (or directories) they were \link[=readHumdrum]{read from}.}

\item{overwrite}{\emph{\strong{Whether to overite existing files.}}

Defaults to \code{FALSE}.

Must be \code{logical}; must be length \code{1}.

If \code{FALSE}, \code{writeHumdrum} will refuse to overwrite
any files. If \code{TRUE}, \code{writeHumdrum} will overwrite files, but only after an additional prompt from the user.}

\item{verbose}{\emph{\strong{Whether to show file names while writing.}}

Defaults to \code{FALSE}.

Must be \code{logical}; must be length \code{1}.

If \code{TRUE}, each \emph{new} output file name is printed on the console
as the writing happens.}

\item{EMD}{\emph{\strong{A string to write to a new \verb{!!!EMD:} record in each file.}}

Defaults to \code{paste0("Edited in humdrumR ", packageVersion('humdrumR'), ' on ', Sys.Date())}.

Must be \code{character}; must be length \code{1}.

If \code{NULL}, not appended.}

\description{
\code{writeHumdrum} writes \code{humdrumR} data into humdrum-syntax text files.
The current \link[=humActive]{active expression} is evaluated to generate the humdrum output
data.
The written output should match the printout if printing the data in the \code{R} terminal.

\section{File names}{


The main option to control with \code{writeHumdrum} is what files to write to.
\code{writeHumdrum} uses the original names of the files, as \link[=readHumdrum]{read by readHumdrum},
as the basis for \emph{new} file names.
By default, \code{writeHumdrum} will refuse to overwrite the original files---overwriting
will only be allowed if you specify \code{overwrite == TRUE} \emph{and} respond with \code{"y"} to a prompt.

\code{writeHumdrum} generates \emph{new} file names by modifying the original read file names.
The \code{renamer} argument must be a function which takes the original names as an input \code{character} vector
(excluding the directory path and the file extension)
and returns a new \code{character} vector of the same length (the default is \code{R}'s identity function \code{force}).
After running \code{renamer}, the \code{character}-string \code{affix} and \code{prefix} arguments
are appended/prepended to the renamed names.
(The \code{affix} is affixed \emph{before} the extension.)
Finally, the \code{extension} argument can be used to specify a different file extension.

The \code{directory} argument indicates a file path where to write the files.
If the \code{directory} doesn't exist, it is created.
If \code{directory} is \code{NULL}, files are written to their original input directory (or directories).

The \code{EMD} argument specifies a character string to put into a new \code{!!!EMD} reference record
at the end of each file.
\code{EMD} records keep track of modifications to humdrum data.
The default behavior is to print a string indicating the \code{humdrumR} version number and date.
If \code{EMD} is set to \code{NULL}, it is not appended to the files.
