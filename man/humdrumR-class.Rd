\description{
This \code{S4} class is the basic unit of the
\link{humdrumR} package.
Each \code{humdrumR} object represents data \link[=readHumdrum]{read} from one or
more humdrum files.
In the documentation we refer to the collection of files within a \linkS4class{humdrumR} object
as a "\strong{corpus}," and each file as a "\strong{piece}."
However, though humdrum data is \emph{usually} encoded as one "piece" per file, this is not necessarily the case:
files might represent movements within a piece, or even just a part of a score. Still, we tend to refer
to them as "pieces."
In coding examples, we name humdrumR objects "\code{humdata}."
}
\details{
The most imporant part of a \code{humdrumR} object is the
\link[=humTable]{humdrum tables} it holds within it.
In essence, an \code{humdrumR} object is simply a wrapper around these
humdrum tables, which helps users to
to visualize, index, \link[=humSummary]{summarize}, and \link[=with-in-Humdrum]{manipulate}
the table in a variety of ways.

Basic information about the size and shape of \code{humdrumR} data can be
obtained with calls to \link[=humSize]{nrecords, npieces, length, ncol, etc.}.
More detailed summary information can be obtained with the humdrumR \link[=humSummary]{corpus summary functions}.
HumdrumR data can also be coerced to more basic R data types using \link[=humCoercion]{as.matrix, as.data.frame, etc.}.
A number of helpful functions are also defined to \link[=humShape]{reshape} humdrumR data.

The most powerful features of \link{humdrumR} are the tools it gives you to
\enumerate{
\item Filter humdrum data, using \link{filterHumdrum} and the standard R \link[base:Extract]{indexing operators}: \verb{[]} and \verb{[[]]}.
\item Apply functions and arbitrary commands to humdrum data using the \link[=with-in-Humdrum]{with(in)Humdrum} routines,
and their associated \link[=humPipe]{piping operators}.
}
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{Humtable}}{A list of \link[=humTable]{humdrum tables}, each having the same fields
but containing data from different types of records (e.g., interpretations, data, barlines, comments).}

\item{\code{Files}}{A list of two elements. The first, "Search", contains a single character representing
the \code{pattern} used in the call to \link{readHumdrum} which created this humdrumR object.
The second, "Names", is a vector of strings representing all the files which matched the \code{pattern}
and were read into the \code{humdrumR} object.}

\item{\code{Fields}}{A list containing strings corresponding to the existing fields in the \code{humdrumR} object.
The fields are divided into five categories: "Data", "Structure", "Interpretation", "Formal", and "Reference"---see
the \link[=humTable]{humdrum table} documentation.}

\item{\code{Active}}{A quosure expression which
extracts data from field(s) in the \link[=humTable]{humdrum table}: the "active expression."}

\item{\code{LoadTime}}{A \link[base:DataTimeClasses]{POSIXct} value, indicating the time at which \link{readHumdrum} was
called to create this \code{humdrumR} object.}

\item{\code{Patterns}}{A character vector of the original search patterns used to match files in the system.}
}}

\section{Active field}{


The \code{Active} slot of a \link{humdrumR} object contains an \link[rlang:quosure]{expression}
which refers to fields in the internal \link[=humTable]{humdrum table}.
Go to the dedicated \link[=humActive]{active field} documentation to learn more about this important slot!
