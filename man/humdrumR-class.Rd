\describe{
\item{\code{Humtable}}{A list of \code{\link[humtable]{humdrum tables}}, each having the same fields
but containing data from different types of records (e.g., interpretations, data, barlines, comments).}

\item{\code{Files}}{A list of two elements. The first, "Search", contains a single character representing
the \code{pattern} used in the call to \code{\link{readHumdrum}} which created this \code{humdrumR} object.
The second, "Names", is a vector of strings representing all the files which matched the \code{pattern}
and were read into the \code{humdrumR} object.}

\item{\code{Layers}}{A list containing strings corresponding to the existing fields in the \code{humdrumR} object.
The fields are divided into four categories: "User", "Structure", "Tandem", and "Reference."
See (\code{\link{layers}})}

\item{\code{Active}}{A formula. The right side of this formula is an expression which 
extracts data from field(s) in the \code{humdrumR} data. The active expression
is the "default" data which is printed be \code{\link{show}} calls, and when \code{.}
is used in a call to \code{\link{humApply}}.
and others.}

\item{\code{Partition}}{A list of partition expressions (see \code{\link{humApply}}). By default,
this is empty, and any partitioning must be done explicitely in the call to \code{\link{humApply}}.
However, if you want a \code{humdrumR} data object to be partitioned by default,
this value can be set with a call to \code{\link{setPartition}}.}

\item{\code{LoadTime}}{A POSIXct value, indicating the time at which \code{\link{readHumdrum}} was
called to create this \code{humdrumR} object.}
}}
