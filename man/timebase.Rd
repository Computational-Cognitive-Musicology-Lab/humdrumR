\title{Represent time on a regular grid}
\usage{
timebase(humdrumR, tb = "16")
}
\arguments{
\item{humdrumR}{\emph{\strong{HumdrumR data.}}

This data must have at least one spine with rhythmic (\link[=rhythmFunctions]{duration}) encoded.}

\item{timebase}{\emph{\strong{The duration of each step in the output sequence.}}

Defaults to a sixteenth-note.

Must be a single atomic value, which can be \link[=rhythmFunctions]{parsed as a duration}, or \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL}, the \code{\link[=tatum]{tatum()}} of the dataset if automatically used as the time base.}
}
\description{
The \code{timebase()} function takes a \link[=humdrumRclass]{humdrumR} dataset
and converts rhythmic information in the data into a step-sequencer like
representation, with each humdrum data record representing one step.
The duration of each step is the the "timebase", which can be controlled with the \code{tb} argument.
The \code{timebase()} function is currently in a beta-draft, so may not work well.
