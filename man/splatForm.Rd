\title{This function takes an expression,
and replaces any subexpression of the form \code{funccall(TargetExpr@GroupingExpr)},
with \code{do.call('funccall', tapply(TargetExpr, GroupingExpr, c))}.
The result is that \code{TargetExpr} is broken into a list of vectors by the
\code{GroupingExpr}, and each group is fed to \code{funccall} as a separate
argument. See the docementation for \code{\link{withinHumdrum}}.
This does not look for \code{@} sub expression within branches of a \code{@} expression!}
