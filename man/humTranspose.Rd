transpose(x, interval = tint(0, 0), generic = NULL, ...)

\method{transpose}{tonalInterval}(x, interval = tint(0, 0),
  generic = NULL)

This function transposes tonalIntervals by other tonal intervals.
By default, does real transposition.
However, if a \code{key} argument is specified, tonal transposition
takes place in that (major) key.
