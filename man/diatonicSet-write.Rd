\description{
These functions all translate \code{\link[humdrumR:humDiatonic]{diatonicSets}} to 
various pitch representations. Diatonic sets can be diatonic keys, or harmonies (the
more specific \code{\link[humdrumR:humDiatonic]{tertianSet}} class).

Roman numerals can be calculated for diatonicSets (keys) and 
for tertian sets (chords).
The later case is the standard meaning of "roman numeral."
However, the former case is used as well, for instance
 to represent modulation schemes in 
analyses of classical music. For instance, modulate from I-V,
the to vi/V.
More importantly, many "roman numerals" in harmonic analyses
implicitely combine tertian and diatonic roman numerals:
in "applied" roman numerals.
Given a roman numeral like "V65/V", the "V65" represents a
chord while the "/V" represents a key.
