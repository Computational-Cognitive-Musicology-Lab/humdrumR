\title{Roman Numeral}
\description{
Roman numerals can be calculated for diatonicSets (keys) and
for tertian sets (chords).
The later case is the standard meaning of "roman numeral."
However, the former case is used as well, for instance
to represent modulation schemes in
analyses of classical music. For instance, modulate from I-V,
the to vi/V.
More importantly, many "roman numerals" in harmonic analyses
implicitely combine tertian and diatonic roman numerals:
in "applied" roman numerals.
Given a roman numeral like "V65/V", the "V65" represents a
chord while the "/V" represents a key.
