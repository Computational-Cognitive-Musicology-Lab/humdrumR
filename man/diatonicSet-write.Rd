\description{
These functions all translate \code{\link[humdrumR:humDiatonic]{diatonicSets}} to 
various pitch representations. Diatonic sets can be diatonic keys, or harmonies (the
more specific \code{\link[humdrumR:humDiatonic]{tertianSet}} class).

"Roman Key" is a relative representation of keys.
This is like what's used to represent modulation schemes in 
analyses of classical music. For instance, modulate from I-V,
the to vi/V.
}
\details{
This is also implicitely what is part of "applied" roman numerals.
Given a roman numeral like "V65/V", the "/V" really represent a roman key,
not a chord.
