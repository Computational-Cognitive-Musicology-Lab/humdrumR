\description{
This function outputs duration information in as traditional \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_value}{note value}.
symbols, as in Western notation.
}
\details{
Note-value symbols are simply encoded in \code{character} vectors, since the
\href{https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/musical-symbols/}{unicode character table} includes these musical symbols.
Of course, this depends on your system having a unicode font installed and working:
the symbols might not show up properly on your machine!
In fact, the symbols always print a bit strangely (out of alignment) and can be hard to manipulate
like "normal" \code{character} strings.

The note-value symbols are most useful for making the labels of plots.
For example, if you tabulate note values and use \code{\link[=barplot]{barplot()}}, you get nice bar labels:\preformatted{chorales <- readHumdrum(humdrumRroot, 'HumdrumData/Chorales/.*krn')
with(chorales, barplot(table(noteValue(Token)), cex.names = 2))

}
