\title{Identify syncopated rhythms}
\usage{
syncopation(dur, meter = duple(5), levels = "all", groupby = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{dur}{\emph{\strong{An input vector of rhythmic durations.}}

Must be a \code{character} or \code{numeric} vector.

Is parsed using \code{\link[=rhythmInterval]{rhythmInterval()}};
Wherever the input can't be parsed as a duration,
that element is treated as a duration of zero.}

\item{meter}{\emph{\strong{The meter(s) to compute levels from.}}

Defaults to a standard, five-level duple (4/4) meter.

Must be a \code{\link[=meter]{meter()}} object or a \code{character} vector.

For \code{character} input, the string is parsed using \code{\link[=meter]{meter()}}; a
failure to parse will result in an error.}

\item{levels}{\emph{\strong{On which metrics levels should we identify syncopations?}}

Defaults to \code{"all"}.

Must be a non-empty \code{character} or \code{numeric} vector.

If \code{levels} is simply the singleton string \code{"all"}, syncopations at any
metric level are identified.
Otherwise, the \code{levels} are parsed with \code{\link[=rhythmInterval]{rhythmInterval()}}; fail to parse may lead to an error.
The parsed levels must be levels of the given \code{\link[=meter]{meter()}}.}

\item{groupby}{\emph{\strong{A \code{list} of vectors to group \code{x}}}

Defaults to \code{list()}.

Must be a \code{list}; every element of the list must be length \code{length(x)}.

To function as a by-record timeline, the \code{groupby} list music include a \emph{named} \code{Piece} and \code{Record} fields.
Luckily, these are automatically passed by \link[=withinHumdrum]{with(in).humdrumR}, so you won't need to worry about it!}

\description{
The \code{syncopation()} function takes a vector of rhythmic duration values and a meter
and identifies which durations are syncopated, return \code{TRUE} for synocopations and \code{FALSE}
otherwise.
The output syncopation depends a lot on how meter is specified/interpreted
so check out the \code{\link[=meter]{meter()}} documentation if you are looking for more control of the output.
}
\details{
A syncopation occurs whenever a rhythmic duration is longer than the highest
metric level that it lands on.

In some cases, we might want to restrict our attention to syncopations that occur
at a specific metric level: for example, "eighth-note syncpations."
We can proved a set of metric levels to the \code{levels} argument, to do this restriction.
The \code{levels} must be parsable as durations which match the levels of the \code{\link[=meter]{meter()}}.
