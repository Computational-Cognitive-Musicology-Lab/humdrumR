\title{Tonal Data Types}
\description{
\code{\link[humdrumR:humdrumR]{humdrumR package}} contains a number of
intertwined \code{S4} data types defined to represent tonal musical information
from the traditional Western persective (i.e., diatonicism).
The most important is the \code{\linkS4class{tonalInterval}}.
There are also the \code{\linkS4class{tonalCenter}} and the \code{\linkS4class{tonalHarmony}}.
