\description{
The \code{draw()} function is humdrumR's go-to plotting function.
\code{draw()} will make a variety of graphs, depending on the type of data you give it.
For the most part, \code{draw()} is simply a stylish, easy to use wrapper around
the base-R graphics functions \code{\link[=plot]{plot()}}, \code{\link[=barplot]{barplot()}}, and \code{\link[=hist]{hist()}}.
}
\details{
\code{draw()} is a generic function, which does different plots depending on the data you pass to its
\code{x} and \code{y} arguments.
\itemize{
\item \code{x} and \code{y} both numeric: scatter plot.
\item \code{x} numeric by itself: histogram.
\item \code{y} numeric by itself: quantile plot.
\item \code{x} is a \link[=count]{table}: barplot or heatmap.
\item \code{y} is numeric, \code{x} is \code{character} or \code{factor}: a violin plot.
}

\code{draw()} is simply a wrapper built on top of R's "base" plotting system.
This means that all the standard arguments to base-R plots can be used to customize plots
(See \code{\link[=par]{par()}} for a full list) or add to them (for example, using \code{\link[=points]{points()}} or \code{\link[=mtext]{mtext()}}).
However, \code{draw()} has a number of special additional features, including easily plotting "facets"
(dividing data into multiple plots).
Anything that \code{draw()} does can be done using normal base-R plotting functions (\code{\link[=plot]{plot()}}, \code{\link[=barplot]{barplot()}}, etc.),
but \code{draw()} makes making good looking plots faster and easier.

The following arguments are the main arguments used with \code{draw()},
though not all arguments will have an effect in all types of plots.
\itemize{
\item Base R:
\itemize{
\item \code{x}: left/right position.
\item \code{y}: up/down position.
\item \code{col}: color.
\itemize{
\item \code{humdrumR} implements a custom color scheme,
which can be accessed by using whole number values for \code{col}.
}
\item \code{cex}: point size.
\item \code{log}: draw on log scale?
}
\item \code{draw()} specific:
\itemize{
\item \code{square}: Should the plot be forced to be square?
\item \code{alpha}: control transparency.
\item \code{quantiles}: mark distribution quantiles.
\item \code{facets}: divide the data into multiple plots.
}
}

Specific methods also have additional arguments.
\subsection{Scatter Plot}{

If both \code{x} and \code{y} are real numbers (\code{\link[=numeric]{numeric()}} in R), a scatter plot is drawn.
These vectors should be the same length, but if one of them is \code{length == 1},
all the points will simply be drawn in a line at that value.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Coloring points} (\code{col} arg)
\itemize{
\item If a single \code{col} value is provided, all points are draw this color.
\item If the \code{col} value is the same length as \code{x} and \code{y}, a scale of colors (either discrete of continuos)
is generated to match the values this variable takes.
\item A legend is drawn.
}
\item \strong{Point size} (\code{cex} arg)
\itemize{
\item If a single \code{cex} value is provided, all points are drawn the same size.
\item If the \code{cex} value is numeric and the same length as \code{x} and \code{y},
a scale of sizes is generated to match the values this variable takes.
This auto-sizing should scale with the area of the points.
\item A legend is drawn.
}
}
