\description{
The \code{draw()} function is humdrumR's goto plotting function.
\code{draw()} can make a variety of graphs, depending on the type of data you give it.
For the most part, \code{draw()} is simply a stylish, easy to use wrapper around
the base-R graphics functions \code{\link[=plot]{plot()}}, \code{\link[=barplot]{barplot()}}, and \code{\link[=hist]{hist()}}.
}
\details{
\code{draw()} is a generic function, which does different plots depending on the data you pass to its
\code{x} and \code{y} arguments.
\itemize{
\item \code{x} and \code{y} both numeric: scatter plot.
\item \code{x} numeric by itself: histogram.
\item \code{y} numeric by itself: quantile plot.
\item \code{x} is a \link[=count]{table}: barplot.
\item \code{y} is numeric, \code{x} is \code{character} or \code{factor}: a violin plot.
}

All the standard arguments to base-R plots can be used to customize plots.
See \code{\link[=par]{par()}} for a full list.
