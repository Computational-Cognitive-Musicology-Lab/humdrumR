\usage{
tertian(
  x,
  ...,
  Key = NULL,
  transposeArgs = list(),
  parseArgs = list(),

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{*** An \code{atomic} vector***

The \code{x} argument can be any (\link[base:vector]{atomic}) vectors}

\item{Key}{*** The input \code{Key} used by the parser, deparser, and transposer. ***

Defaults to \code{NULL}.

Must be a \code{diatonicSet} or something coercable to \code{diatonicSet}; must be either length \code{1} or \code{length(x)}}

\item{transposeArgs}{*** A list of arguments that are passed to a special call to \link{transpose}. ***

Defaults to \code{list()}.

Must be a \code{list}.}

\item{parseArgs}{*** A list of arguments that are passed to the \link[=pitchParsing]{pitch parser}. ***

Defaults to \code{list()}.

Must be a \code{list}.}

\item{inPlace}{*** Whether the result is placed in place or returned ***

Defaults to \code{FALSE}.

Must be a \code{logical}; must be length \code{1}.}

\description{
This functions a generic form of tertian harmony representation, commonly used in music theory.
In this representation, the root of a chord is indicated as **kern, followed by one or more
quality indicators, like \code{"CMM"} (C major seventh).
}
\details{
The first quality after the root indicates the quality of the triad.
Subsequent qualities, if present, indicate the quality of the 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th respectively.
Some examples:
\itemize{
\item \code{M}: major triad
\item \code{Mm}: dominant-seventh chord
\item \code{MM}: major-seventh chord
\item \code{Mmm}: dominant-seventh-with-flat-9 chord.
\item \code{oo}: fully-diminished-seventh chord.
}

Missing extensions can be indicated in their position using \code{.}.
For example, \code{E-Mm.P} indicates a E-flat dominant-11th chord with no 9th.
Missing members of the triad can be indicated by specifying either \code{5} or \code{3} immediately after the root, but before any
quality indicators.
For example, \code{C5M} indicates a C major chord with no 3rd, while \code{G3mm} indicates a G-minor-seventh chord with missing 5th.

The default quality indicators are \code{P} (perfect), \code{M} (major), \code{m} (minor), \code{o} (diminished), or \code{+} (augmented), but these
can be overridden by calls to their respective arguments: for example, \code{tertian('Cdim', diminish = 'd')}.
}
\section{Inversions}{


Inversions are indicated with slash notation, with the scale degree to the right of the slash.
For example, a first-inversion A major chord would be \code{AM/3}.
