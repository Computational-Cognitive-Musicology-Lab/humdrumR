\title{Translate between durations and tempos}
\usage{
bpm2sec(BPM, unit = 0.25)

sec2bpm(sec, unit = 0.25)

bpm2ms(BPM, unit = 0.25)

ms2bpm(ms, unit = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{BPM}{A \code{character} string (which may or may not be be prefixed with \code{"*MM"}) or numeric values,
which are interpreted as a beats-per-minute value.}

\item{unit}{A value which can be interpreted as a \code{\link[=duration]{duration()}}``}
}
\description{
Functions for translating between durations (in seconds) and \emph{tempos}---expressed as BPM (beats-per-minute).
The "beats" in beats-per-minute are specified using the \code{unit} argument;
\code{unit} defaults to \code{.25} (a quarter-note), as is conventional.
}
\details{
The pairs of functions involving \code{ms} (milliseconds) and \code{sec} (seconds), are identical except
for the change of scale between seconds and milliseconds.
