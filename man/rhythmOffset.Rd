\title{Calculate rhythmic "offset"}
\usage{
rhythmOffset(durations, start = 0, bars = NULL, tatum = 1, as = as.decimal)
}
\arguments{
\item{durations}{A vector of numeric values representing durations.}

\item{start}{A duration value (coerced to same class as \code{durations}), from which the
offset begins.}

\item{groups}{A vector of equal length as \code{durations} representing a grouping factor,
usable by \verb{[base][tapply]}. If \code{!is.null(groups)}, offsets are calculated
for duration values within each group. The \code{start} argument is recycle to match
the length of the number of groups, so a different start value can be applied to each group.
If \code{is.null(groups)}, offsets are calculated for the whole \code{durations} vector, from the
first \code{start} value.}
}
\description{
Borrowing the term from \code{music21}, rhythmic "offset"
refers to a duration of time since a starting point (usually, the beginning
of a piece).
\code{rhythmOffset} takes a vector of numbers representing durations
(maybe \verb{[rhythmInterval][rhythmInterval]s}, maybe other
numeric values) and cummulatively sums them from a starting value.
The output is a vector of durations of the same type as the input
where each output value corresponds to the duration of time elapsed
at that point.
