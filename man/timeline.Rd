\usage{
timeline(
  x,
  start = 0,
  ...,
  Exclusive = NULL,
  parseArgs = list(),
  groupby = list()
)

timestamp(
  x,
  BPM = "MM60",
  start = 0,
  minutes = TRUE,
  ...,
  Exclusive = NULL,
  parseArgs = list(),
  groupby = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An input vector which is parsed for duration information using the \link[=rhythmParsing]{rhythm parser}.}

\item{start}{A \code{numeric} value from which the timeline begins, or a \code{logical} vector of same length as \code{x}.}

\item{parseArgs}{A \code{list} of arguments to pass to the \link[=rhythmInterval]{rhythm parser}.}

\item{groupby}{A \code{list} of vectors, of the same length as \code{x}, which are used to group \code{x} into.
To function as a by-record timeline, the \code{groupby} list music include a \emph{named} \code{Piece} and \code{Record} fields.
Luckily, these are automatically passed by \link[=withinHumdrum]{with(in).humdrumR}, so you won't need to worry about it!}

\item{minutes}{(\code{logical}, \code{length == 1}) If \code{TRUE}, output seconds are converted to a character string
encoding minutes, seconds, and milliseconds in the format \code{MM.SS.ms}.}

\item{`BPM`}{A numeric values or \code{character} string in the format \code{"MM120"} (for 120 bpm). By default,
\link[=withinHumdrum]{with(in).humdrumR} passed the \code{BPM} \link[=fields]{field}, if present.}
}
\description{
These functions calculate the ammount of time (either in beats, or seconds)
that have unfolded since the beginning of a piece, giving a sense of the timeline in which events unfold.
In \code{music21} this inforfmation is described as "offsets"---however,
we prefer to reserve the words "onset" and "offset" to refer
to the beginning (attack) and end (release) of rhythmic events.
}
\details{
Music unfolds over time, and humdrum data typically represents this
by placing simultanteous events in the same record, with successive events
in ever higher records---progressing "top down" through the file.
In some humdrum data, only this (implicit) ordering of data over time is present.
The \code{Record} and \code{NData} \link[=fields]{fields} capture this ordering in all data parsed by \code{humdrumR}.
However, many (probably most) humdrum data files contain at least some information about the relative
duration of events, representing more detailed information about timing and rhythm.

\code{timeline()} parses and input vector \code{x} as \link[=duration]{durations},
computes the \link[=sigma]{cumulative sum} of the durations, with the \code{start} argument appended to the beginning.
The result is a \code{numeric} vector representing the total duration since the beginning of the vector (plus the value of \code{start}, which defaults to zero).
The cumulative durations of \code{timeline()} represent musical duration units, where \code{1} equals a whole note.
\code{timestamp()} converts these durations to seconds, either using the \code{BPM} argument/field to determine the tempo or using the
default tempo of 60 beats per minute.
If \code{minutes == TRUE}, the output is formatted into \code{"minute:seconds.milliseconds"} character strings.

If a \code{groupby} argument is provided, \code{\link[=localDuration]{localDuration()}} is used to compute the minimum durations in each group before
computing the cumulative sum only with unique values from each \code{Record} in the \code{groupby}.
By default, \link[=withinHumdrum]{with(in).humdrumR} will automatically pass \code{groupby = list(Piece = Piece, Record = Record)}
into calls to \code{timeline()} or \code{timestamp()}.
Thus, a call like \code{within(humData, timeline(Token))} will compute the correct timeline position for \emph{all}
tokens across all spines/paths/stops---all values in the same record will be the same.

Note that, \code{timeline()} and \code{timestamp()} follow the default behavior of \code{\link[=duration]{duration()}} by treating grace-notes as duration \code{0}.
If you want to use the duration(s) of grace notes, specify \code{grace = TRUE}.
}
\section{Logical start}{


Another option is to pass the \code{start} argument a logical vector of the same length as the input \code{x}.
Within each piece, the the \emph{first} timepoint where the \code{start} logical is \code{TRUE} is used as the zero:
all early points will be negative numbers.
In \code{humdrumR}, and datapoints before the first barline record (\code{=}) are labeled \code{Bar == 0} in the \code{Bar} \link[=fields]{field}.
Thus, a common use for a \code{logical} \code{start} argument is \verb{within(humData, timeline(Token, start = Bar == 1)}, which makes the downbeat of
the first complete bar \code{0}---any notes in a pickup bar are give negative numbers on the timeline.

\examples{

humData <- readHumdrum(humdrumRroot, "HumdrumData/BeethovenVariations/.*krn")

within(humData, timeline(Token))

within(humData, timestamp(Token, minutes = TRUE))
