\description{
\verb{diatonicSet`` is one of \code{\link[humdrumR:humdrumR]{humdrumR}}'s  \code{\link[humdrumR:humTonality]{types of tonal data}}, representing Western diatonic keys. }diatonicSet` is a subeclass of (inherits from) \link[humdrumR:struct]{humdrumR::struct}, so they act like vectors/matrices.

\code{tertianSet} is one of \code{\link[humdrumR:humdrumR]{humdrumR}}'s
\code{\link[humdrumR:humTonality]{types of tonal data}}, representing Western tertian harmonies.
\code{tertianSet} is a subclass of \code{diatonicSet} (and thus, \code{struct}).

\details{
A key is represented by two integers, \code{Root} and \code{Mode}.
Root is simply the tonic note of the key on the circle of fifths.
Mode is a value on the circle of fifths, indicating the diatonic mode.
You can think of the Mode value as indicating the number of accidentals, with negative numbers
for flats and positive numbers for sharps.
The standard diatonic modes occur if the \code{Mode - Tonic} is in the range -5:1:
\itemize{
\item{+1 = Lydian}
\item{+0 = Major (Ionian)}
\item{-1 = Mixolydian}
\item{-2 = Dorian}
\item{-3 = Minor (Aeolian)}
\item{-4 = Phyrgian}
\item{-5 = Locrian}
}

In addition there is an \code{Alteration} slot (also integers), which can be used to create various
"altered" scales. To understand how the \code{Alteration} integer works, first consider how the \code{Mode} (key-signature)
integer works.
Think of it like this, we start with a natural diatonic set consisting of the numbers \verb{[-1 0 1 2 3 4 5]} (C major) on the line of fifths:
If the \code{Mode} integer is \code{+1}, everyathing is shifted up one to be \verb{[0 1 2 3 4 5 6]} (C Lydian).
You can think of this as \code{+1} being added to each number, but instead, think of it has the following operation:
remove the lowest (leftmost number) from the vector, add 7 to that number, then append it on the rightmost side.
If we follow this operation, we take 0 off the left, and add 7 to the end, getting \verb{[0 1 2 3 4 5 6]}.
If \code{Mode} is greater than one, we repeat this operation however many times, and if \code{Mode} is negative, we just reverse the procedure.
This way of thinking about the \code{Mode} value is convoluted, but it helps us under stand the \code{Alteration} operation.
The \code{Alteration} integer does the same operation on a key as \code{Mode}, except we take the \emph{second}-most left/right value and add/subtract 7.
So if \code{Alteration == -1}, \verb{[-1 0 1 2 3 4 5]} becomes \verb{[-3 -1 0 1 2 3 5]} (C melodic minor);
If \code{Alteration == -2}, \verb{[-1 0 1 2 3 4 5]} becomes \verb{[-4 -3 -1 0 1 2 5]} (C harmonic minor); and so on.
In fact, \code{Alteration == -1} results in all diatonic sets which are modes of the \emph{melodic minor} scale, and
\code{Alteration == -2} results in diatonic sets which are modes of the \emph{harmonic minor} scale.
Other \code{Alteration} values get us increasingly exotic scales!
