\description{
\code{tertianSet} is one of \link[=humdrumR]{humdrumR's}
types of tonal data, representing Western tertian harmonies.
\code{tertianSet} is a subclass of \code{diatonicSet} (and thence, \code{struct}).
}
\details{
The only structural addition, compared to \code{diatonicSet}, is the \code{Extensions} slot.
This slot indicates which tertian chord members are active in the chord.
There are seven possible chord members:
the root, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth.
Every possible combination of these seven degrees is represented by a single integer, corresponding
to the 7-bit representation of on/offs on the seven degrees in reverse order (13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1).
For example, the integer \code{15} corresponds to a seventh chord: in binary, 15 is \code{0001111}.
The initial three zeros indicate that the 13th, 11th, and 9th are \emph{not} part of the harmony, while the four ones
indicate that the root, third, fifth, and seventh \emph{are} part of the harmony.
Ultimately, adding or removing a chord degree from a harmony can be achieved by adding the power of
two associated with that degree:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Root}: \eqn{\pm 1}
\item \strong{Third}: \eqn{\pm 2}
\item \strong{Fifth}: \eqn{\pm 4}
\item \strong{Seventh}: \eqn{\pm 8}
\item \strong{Ninth}: \eqn{\pm 16}
\item \strong{Eleventh}: \eqn{\pm 32}
\item \strong{Thirteenth}: \eqn{\pm 64}
}

\code{tertianSet} has many specific methods defined for reading/writing harmonic information.
