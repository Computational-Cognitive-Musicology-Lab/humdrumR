\description{
\code{getActive(humdata)} is simply an accessor for the humdrumR object's Active quosure.

\code{setActive} takes a \link{humdrumR} object and a formula
and sets the right side of formula as the object's Active expression.

\code{setActiveFields} takes a character vector of strings representing current
\code{\link[humdrumR:humTable]{field}} names
and sets the \link{humdrumR} object's active expression
to simply return those fields (as a list, if there are more than one).
