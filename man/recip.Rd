\usage{
recip(
  x,
  ...,
  sep = "\%",
  parseArgs = list(),
  scale = 1,
  unit = 1,
  inPlace = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{*** An \code{atomic} vector***

The \code{x} argument can be any (\link[base:vector]{atomic}) vector, or a \link[=rational]{rational (rhythmInterval)}, or \code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{These arguments are passed to the \link[=rhythmParsing]{rhythm parser}.
There are also two hidden (advanced) arguments you can specify: \code{memoize} and \code{deparse} (see the details below).}

\item{sep}{*** A \code{character} string to use as the separator between denominator and numerator.***

Must be \code{character}; must be length \code{1}.}

\item{parseArgs}{*** A list of arguments that are passed to the \link[=rhythmParsing]{rhythm parser}. ***

Defaults to \code{list()}.

Must be a \code{list}.}

\item{scale}{*** A \code{numeric} or \link{rational} value which is used as the output unit of measurement ***

Defaults to \code{rational(1, 1)}.

Must be \code{numeric} or \link{rational}.}

\item{inPlace}{*** Whether the result is placed in place or returned ***

Defaults to \code{FALSE}.

Must be a \code{logical}; must be length \code{1}.}

\description{
The standard approach to representing conventional note values in humdrum
is the "reciprocal" \href{https://www.humdrum.org/rep/recip/index.html}{**recip}.
Representation.
The \verb{**recip} rhythmic values are often used as a part of \verb{**kern} representation,
which also includes \link[=kern]{pitch} information and notation details.
}
\details{
\verb{**recip} values are literally the reciprocal of a duration value.
Since most note values in conventional music notation are simple fractions
the reciprocal approach is highly concise and very similar to conventional western notation and terminology.
A "quarter note" is represented as the reciprocal of 1/4: simply \code{"4"}.
Full reciprocal fractions can be specified: \code{"2\%3"} to indicate 3/2.
The \verb{\%} separator can be changed using the \code{sep} argument.

As in conventional \link[=notehead]{note values}, "dots" can be added after a value to increase the duration by
the ratio of \code{(2 - (2^{-n}))}, where \code{n} is the number of dots.
(One dot is 3/2; two dots is 7/4; etc.).
