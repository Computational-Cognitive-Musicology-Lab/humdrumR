\usage{
recip(
  x,

  sep = "\%",
  parseArgs = list(),
  scale = 1,
  unit = 1,
  as.factor = factor.default,
  inPlace = FALSE

\arguments{
\item{x}{(\code{atomic} vector) The \code{x} argument can be any (\link[base:vector]{atomic}) vector, or a \link[=rational]{rational (rhythmInterval)}, or \code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{These arguments are passed to the \link[=rhythmDeparsing]{rhythm deparser}.
There are also two hidden (advanced) arguments you can specify: \code{memoize} and \code{deparse} (see the details below).}

\item{sep}{(\code{character}, \code{length == 1}) A \code{character} string to use as the separator
between denominator and numerator.}

\item{parseArgs}{(\code{list}) \code{parseArgs} can be a list of arguments that are passed to the \link[=rhythmParsing]{rhythm parser}.}

\item{scale}{A \code{numeric} or \link{rational} value which is used as the output unit of measurement: the default value for most functions
is \code{rational(1, 1)}, a whole-note or "duration."}

\item{inPlace}{(\code{logical}, \code{length == 1}) This argument only has an effect if the input (the \code{x} argument) is \code{character} strings,
\emph{and} there is extra, non-duration information in the input strings "besides" the rhythm information.
If so, and \code{inPlace = TRUE}, the output will be placed into an output string beside the original non-rhythm information.
If \code{inPlace = FALSE}, only the rhythm output information will be returned (details below).}

\description{
The standard approach to representing conventional note values in humdrum
is the "reciprocal" \href{https://www.humdrum.org/rep/recip/index.html}{**recip}.
Representation.
The \verb{**recip} rhythmic values are often used as a part of \verb{**kern} representation,
which also includes \link[=kern]{pitch} information and notation details.
}
\details{
\verb{**recip} values are literally the reciprocal of a duration value.
Since most note values in conventional music notation are simple fractions
the reciprocal approach is highly concise and very similar to conventional western notation and terminology.
A "quarter note" is represented as the reciprocal of 1/4: simply \code{"4"}.
Full reciprocal fractions can be specified: \code{"2\%3"} to indicate 3/2.
The \verb{\%} separator can be changed using the \code{sep} argument.

As in conventional \link[=notehead]{note values}, "dots" can be added after a value to increase the duration by
the ratio of \code{(2 - (2^{-n}))}, where \code{n} is the number of dots.
(One dot is 3/2; two dots is 7/4; etc.).
