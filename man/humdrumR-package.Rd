\title{humdrumR: a toolkit for the analysis of humdrum data.}
\description{
humdrumR is a toolkit for the analysis of
musical peformance or analysis data encoded in the Humdrum syntax.
There is also a \code{\link{humdrumR}} function.
}
\details{
The package includes three basic contributions.
The first is the humScore S3 class, which is basically a data.frame
with a few additional attributes and methods which
make them more suitable for representing humdrum data.
The second is the humdrumR S3 object, which is a closure of multiple functions
for manipulating sets of humScores.
The last is a set of functions for manipulating and analyzing
humScores, as well as special syntax for composing
new functions.
