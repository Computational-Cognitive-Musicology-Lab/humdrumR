\title{To take the modulo of a tonalInterval, it doesn't make sense 
to take the modulo of the Fifth and the Octave separately.
Rather, we take the modulo of the Fifth normally, but for the octave
we look at how many time the Fifth values was divided by the Fifth modulus
and subtract that number multiplied by the octave modulus.
That way the change applied to the Octave matches the one applied to the Fifth.}
