\title{Get tandem interpretation information from humdrum data.}
\usage{
getTandem(tandem, regex)
}
\description{
The every \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} object has a field called
\code{Tandem} which is a vector of strings which accumulates
tandem interpretations in each Spine. This function (\code{getTandem})
extracts tandem interpretations from this field, based on a matching
regular expression. The obligatory \code{'*'} \emph{does not} need to
be included in the \code{regex}, as it is added automatically. Thus,
if you want to find tandem interpretations that match '*clef..', you
just have to write \code{regex = 'clef..'}.
