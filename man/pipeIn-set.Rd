\title{This is the main function for taking the output of a
function or expression applied to humtable data and putting
it back into the humtable. If the output and input are the same length,
it's easy. The hard part is what to do when the output is different than
the input. This function hard codes a few common possibilities,
but deserves thorough updating (11/29/2018, Nat Condit-Schultz).}
