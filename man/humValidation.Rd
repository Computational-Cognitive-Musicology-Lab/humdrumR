validateHumdrum(pattern = NULL, recursive = FALSE,
  errorReport.path = NULL, files = NULL)
}

\item{recursive}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, the final part of the serach pattern (i.e., the file search) 
is searched for recursively through all sub directories.}

\item{errorReport.path}{\code{character}. A directory path which, if not \code{NULL}, an error report is written

are written to this directory (with \code{'errorMarkup'} appended to their names), with 
errors annotated inline.}

\item{files}{A list of character strings, each representing a record in a file.}
