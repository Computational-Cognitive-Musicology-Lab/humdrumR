\title{Tabulate records and tokens in a humdrumR corpus}
\usage{
census(humdrumR, dataTypes = "GLIMDd")

census(humdata)[i]

\method{print}{humCensus}(censusTable, showall = TRUE)
}
\description{
\code{census} is one of \code{\link[humdrumR:humdrumR]{humdrumR's}}
\code{\link[humdrumR:humSummary]{summary functions}}, used to
tabulate the raw size of a \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} corpus.
\code{census} takes a \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} object
and and returns a \code{\strong{humCensus}} table.
The \code{dataType} argument controls what types of records to tabulate:
legal values are \code{'G', 'L', 'I', 'M', 'D', 'd'}
or any combination of these (e.g., \code{"LIM"}).
The default is \code{"D"}.
}
\details{
A \code{humCensus} table has five columns of information:
\describe{
\item{Records}{The total number of records.}
\item{Tokens}{The total number of tokens.}
\item{(unique)}{The number of \strong{unique} tokens}
\item{Characters}{The total numbder of characters. This includes
humdrum control characters like \code{"*"} and \code{"!!"}.}
\item{(per token)}{This is simply \code{Characters / Tokens},
indicating the mean length of each token.}
}
A \code{humCensus} table has one row for each file in the corpus.
Rows are labeled with each file's corresponding
number (from the \code{\link[humdrumR:humTable]{humTable's}} \strong{File} field)
and name (the \strong{Filename} field).
In addition, when a \code{humCensus} object is printed,
the totals across all files are printed as well---(unique) and (per token)
across all files are calculated across all files as well, not summed.
}
\section{Indexing}{

Rows of a \code{humCensus} object can be selected with a single argument \code{i}:
e.g., \code{censusTable[i]}.
If \code{i} is \code{numeric}, the corresponding rows are selected ordinally (not by
\code{File} number).
If \code{i} is a \code{character} string, this string is mached
as a regular expression against file names.
If \code{i} is a formula, the right-hand side of the formula
is evaluated within the table---if it evaluates to a logical vector,
files are selected accordingly. For instance,
\code{censusTable[~Tokens > 100]} will select all files
with more than 100 tokens. (The '(unique)' and '(per token)' columns
must be referred to with their names enclosed in \code{``}---for example,
\code{censusTable[~`(unique)` > 100]} will return all files with
more than 100 unique tokens.

A \code{drop} argument is also available. If \code{TRUE}, a plain
\code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} is returned.
