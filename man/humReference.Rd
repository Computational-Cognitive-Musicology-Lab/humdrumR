\description{
\code{reference} is one of \code{\link[humdrumR:humdrumR]{humdrumR's}}
\code{\link[humdrumR:humSummary]{summary functions}}, used to
tabulate the reference records
present in a \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} corpus.
\code{reference} takes a \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} object
and and returns a \code{\strong{humReference}} table.
Alternatively, \code{reference} can take a \code{character} string,
which it will check against known reference codes and print a
information about matching codes. For instance, \code{reference('OTL')}
returns a description of the standard humdrum \code{!!!OTL} reference record
(original title metadata).
}
\details{
A \code{humReference} table has one column for 
each reference code that appears in a \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} corpus.
Since reference records can be long (too much to print on one screen),
and humdrum files can have multiple of the same type of reference code
(for instance multiple composers annotated with "!!!COM"),
by default, a \code{humReference} only prints the number of each type of 
reference record to appear in each file.
However, if only one type of reference code is present in a
\code{humReference} table, the complete reference records for that code
will be printed for each file. Likewise, if only one file is present
in the table, all of that file's complete reference records are printed.
Thus, if you want to see actualy reference records, try indexing the
\code{humReference} table down to one column or row (see below).

A \code{humReference} table has one row for each file in the corpus.
Rows are labeled with each file's corresponding 
number (from the \code{\link[humdrumR:humTable]{humTables}} \strong{File} field)
 and name (the \strong{Filename} field).
In addition, when a \code{humReference} object is printed,
three different summary totals are printed for each reference code:
\strong{Any} indicates how many files in the corpus have at least
one example of each code in them. 
\strong{Sum} indicates the total number of each reference code to appear
in the corpus, including multiple appearances in one file (like multiple "!!!COM"
records).
Finally, \strong{Unique} tabulates the number of unique tokens in each reference
code---if your corpus only hase two unique composers (encoded in "!!!COM"),
the \strong{Unique} total will be \code{2}.

\section{Indexing}{


\code{humReference} tables can be indexed much like base \code{R}
\code{\link[base:data.frame]{data.frames}}, with two arguments: \code{i} (rows)
and \code{j} (columns).
If \code{i} or {j} are \code{numeric}, they select
rows or columns respectively, ordinally.
If \code{i} is a \code{character}, it is matched as a regular expression
against filenames in the corpus.
If \code{j} is a \code{character}, it is \code{\link[base:pmatch]{partially-matched}}
 against column names.

A \code{drop} argument is also available. If \code{TRUE}, a plain 
\code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} is returned.
