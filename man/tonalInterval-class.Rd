\description{
This \emph{S4} class is the core tonal pitch representation in the 
\code{\link[humdrumR:humdrumR]{humdrumR package}}.
The object is used to represent tonal pitch names ("C", "G#", "Db", etc.), tonal intervals 
and scale degrees ("Major 3rd", "Diminished 5th", etc.), and solfege ("Do", "Re", "Fi", etc.).
Each pitch/interval is represented as two integers: one representing octave, the other
position on the circle of fifths. These values are held in the slots \code{@Octave} 
and \code{@Fifth}. 
The interval/pitch represented is the result of the Octaves and Perfect 5ths (actually, Perfect
*12ths*) in the slots added together.
}
\details{
This class has all the basic methods enabled for it function like a normal R vector. 
(Each slot can actually hold a vector of integers representing
Octaves/Fifths). This means you can apply normal vectorized commands to it.

In the case of fifths, it is not difficult (for learned musicians at least) to 
see how the numbers related to tonal pitch names (C = 0, G = 1, D = 2, A = 3, 
A# = 10, Bb = -2, etc.), intervals (P1 = 0, P5 = 1, M2 = 2, M6 = 3, A6 = 10, m7 = -2, etc.),
solfege (Do = 0, So = 1, Re = 2, La = 3, Li = 10, Te = -2, etc.).
It's just the circle of fifths!
However, how the Fifth and Octave numbers relate to specific intervals/pitches
is not immediately intuitive, and not is not conducive to human reading. For instance,
given the pair \eqn{(Octave = -3, Fifth = 3)}{(Octave = -3, Fifth = 3)}, I can quicklty recognize that this \code{tonalInterval}
refers to the tonal name "A" (or the interval "Major 6th", or the solfege "La", etc.).
However, it is difficult (even for me) to immediately recognize *which* "A" this is.
This is ok! And it is intentional. The representation is meant to make coding easier, not for users
to actually interact with. (Functions to read/write \code{tonalInteval}s to more familiar
representations are provided with \code{humdrumR}.)

The way the integers in the \code{@Octave} and \code{@Fifth} slots are interpreted is as follows:
We can think of each \code{Octave} as corresponding to 12 semitones, and each \code{Fifth} corresponding
to 19 semitones (Perfect 12th). Thus, \deqn{(Octave = -1, Fifth = 1) = -12 + 19 = 7}
or the example from previous paragraph:
\deqn{(O=-3, F=3) = -12*3 + 19*3 = -36 + 57 = 21}
which means the "Major 6" is actually a major 13th.
More generally can also think of the two integers as exponents of two bases: \deqn{(O, F) = 2^O * ~3^F}.
If the \code{Fifth} base is actually 3, this represents a "pure" 12th, and thus
the resulting numbers represent *Pythagorean Tuning*.
\deqn{2^{-1} * 3^{1} = \frac{3^1}{2^1} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5}
If we instead use as our fifth base \eqn{2^{\frac{19}{12}}} we 
will get equal temperement:
\deqn{2^{-1} * {2^{\frac{19}{12}}}^1 = 2^{\frac{7}{12}}}
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{Fifth}}{An integer representing the intervals
size on the circle of fifths. When considering absolute size
these fifths are actually treated like pure \emph{12ths} (i.e., one 
fifth + one octave): 19 semitones, or \deqn{3^1}.}

\item{\code{Octave}}{An integer representing the octave offset of the interval
(in addition to the fifth). See details for full explanation.}
}}

\section{Relational Operators}{

\code{tonalInnterval}s can be compared using the standard
\code{\link[base:Comparison]{relational operators}}---\code{==},
\code{!=}, \code{>}, \code{>=}, etc.
\code{tonalIntervals}s are equal only if their \code{Octave} and
\code{Fifth} slots are identical. Numeric comparisons are (i.e., \code{>}, 
\code{<=}) based on their semitone (equal temperament) size.
