\item{drop}{This argument is concetually similar to the \code{drop} argument in R matrices and data.frames.
If \code{drop = TRUE}, the output of \code{withHumdrum} is simplified as much as possible (trying to return
the "raw" vector, list, table, etc. within it). If \code{drop = FALSE}, the result is \emph{always}
a \code{data.table}. The default value (\code{drop = TRUE}) is usually what we want because it is more
intuitive, but in more complex code, it can be helpful to set \code{drop = FALSE} so that
the output is consistent.}
