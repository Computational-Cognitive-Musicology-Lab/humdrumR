\description{
This \code{S4} class is the basic unit of the
\link{humdrumR} package.
Each \verb{humdrumR object} represents data \link[=readHumdrum]{read} from one or
more humdrum files.
In the documentation, we refer to these objects interchangeably as
"\code{humdrumR} corpora", "\code{humdrumR} objects," or \code{humdrumR} data(sets).
In coding examples we name them "\code{humData}."
}
\details{
The most important part of a \code{humdrumR} object is the
\link[=humTable]{humdrum tables} it holds within it;
In essence, a \code{humdrumR} object is simply a wrapper around its
humdrum table, which helps users to
to visualize, \link[=subset.humdrumR]{index}, \link[=humSummary]{summarize}, and \link[=withinHumdrum]{manipulate}
the table in a variety of ways.

Basic information about the size and shape of \code{humdrumR} objects can be
obtained with calls to \link[=humSize]{nrecord, npiece, length, ncol, etc.}.
More detailed summary information can be obtained with the humdrumR \link[=humSummary]{corpus summary functions}.
\code{humdrumR} data can also be coerced to more basic R data types using \link[=humCoercion]{as.matrix, as.data.frame, etc.}.
A number of helpful functions are also defined to "reshape" or reorganize the
data (e.g., \code{\link[=foldHumdrum]{foldHumdrum()}}, \code{\link[=collapseHumdrum]{collapseHumdrum()}}).

The most powerful features of \link{humdrumR} are the tools it gives you to...
\itemize{
\item Print a readable view of the data in shorthand/curtailed humdrum syntax.
\item Filter \code{humdrumR} data, using \code{\link[=subset.humdrumR]{subset.humdrumR()}} and the standard \code{R} \link[base:Extract]{indexing operators}: \verb{[]} and \verb{[[]]}.
\item Apply arbitrary commands to \link[=humTable]{humtable} fields using the \link[=withinHumdrum]{with(in)Humdrum} routines.
}
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{Humtable}}{A \link[=humTable]{humdrum tables}---i.e, a \code{\link[data.table:data.table]{data.table::data.table()}} with particular fields.}

\item{\code{Files}}{A list of two elements. The first, "\code{Search}", contains a single character representing
the \code{pattern} used in the call to \code{\link[=readHumdrum]{readHumdrum()}} which created this humdrumR object.
The second, "\code{Names}," is a vector of strings representing all the files which matched the \code{pattern}
and were read into the \code{humdrumR} object, with \code{\link[=names]{names()}} corresponding to their "subcorpora" labels (\code{Label}).}

\item{\code{Fields}}{A \link{data.table} indicating the existing fields in the \code{humdrumR} object's
\link[=humTable]{humdrum table}.
The fields are divided into five categories: "Data", "Structure", "Interpretation", "Formal", and "Reference."}

\item{\code{LoadTime}}{A \link[base:DateTimeClasses]{POSIXct} value, indicating the time at which \code{\link[=readHumdrum]{readHumdrum()}} was
called to create this \code{humdrumR} object.}
}}

\section{Printing}{


If you type the name of an object on the R command line, R will "print" the object in the console.
A \code{humdrumR} object will, by default, print a humdrum-syntax score representation.
The print/view settings for humdrumR can be manipulated with the \code{\link[=humdrumR]{humdrumR()}} function.
Most notably, by calling \code{humdrumR('table')}, \code{humdrumR} will switch or printing a view of the underlying \link[=humTable]{humdrum table},
rather than the humdrum-syntax score.
You can return to the score view by calling \code{humdrumR('humdrum')}.
If there are more than one pieces in the object, the beginning of the first piece is printed, followed by the end of the last piece.
For more details on printing options, read the \code{\link[=humdrumR]{humdrumR()}} manual.

When \code{humdrumR(view = 'table')}, the long \link[=humTable]{humdrum table} is printed.
The \code{Piece}, \code{Spine}, and \code{Record} fields will always print in the output table, as well as \code{Path} and \code{Stop} if any
paths/stops are present.
After these stuctural fields, any/all selected fields are shown.
When \code{humdrumR(view = 'humdrum')} (the default) a humdrumR score is printed, with record numbers enumerated at the left edge.
