\description{
This \code{S4} class is the basic unit of the
\link{humdrumR} package.
Each \verb{humdrumR object} represents data \link[=readHumdrum]{read} from one or
more humdrum files.
In the documentation, we refer to these objects interchangeably as
"\code{humdrumR} corpora", "\code{humdrumR} objects," or \code{humdrumR} data(sets).
In coding examples we name them "\code{humData}."
}
\details{
The most important part of a \code{humdrumR} object is the
\link[=humTable]{humdrum tables} it holds within it;
In essence, a \code{humdrumR} object is simply a wrapper around its
humdrum table, which helps users to
to visualize, \link[=subset.humdrumR]{index}, \link[=humSummary]{summarize}, and \link[=withinHumdrum]{manipulate}
the table in a variety of ways.

Basic information about the size and shape of \code{humdrumR} objects can be
obtained with calls to \link[=humSize]{nrecord, npiece, length, ncol, etc.}.
More detailed summary information can be obtained with the humdrumR \link[=humSummary]{corpus summary functions}.
\code{humdrumR} data can also be coerced to more basic R data types using \link[=humCoercion]{as.matrix, as.data.frame, etc.}.
A number of helpful functions are also defined to "reshape" or reorganize the
data (e.g., \code{\link[=foldHumdrum]{foldHumdrum()}}, \code{\link[=collapseHumdrum]{collapseHumdrum()}}), or extract the data into "normal" \code{R}
data structures (e.g, \code{\link[=as.matrix.humdrumR]{as.matrix.humdrumR()}}, \code{\link[=evalActive]{evalActive()}}).

The most powerful features of \link{humdrumR} are the tools it gives you to...
\itemize{
\item Print a readable view of the data in shorthand/curtailed humdrum syntax.
\item Filter \code{humdrumR} data, using \code{\link[=subset.humdrumR]{subset.humdrumR()}} and the standard \code{R} \link[base:Extract]{indexing operators}: \verb{[]} and \verb{[[]]}.
\item Apply arbitrary commands to \link[=humTable]{humtable} fields using the \link[=:withinHumdrum]{with(in)Humdrum} routines.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{Humtable}}{A \link[=humTable]{humdrum tables}---i.e, a \code{\link[data.table:data.table]{data.table::data.table()}} with particular fields.}

\item{\code{Files}}{A list of two elements. The first, "\code{Search}", contains a single character representing
the \code{pattern} used in the call to \code{\link[=readHumdrum]{readHumdrum()}} which created this humdrumR object.
The second, "\code{Names}," is a vector of strings representing all the files which matched the \code{pattern}
and were read into the \code{humdrumR} object, with \code{\link[=names]{names()}} corresponding to their "subcorpora" labels (\code{Label}).}

\item{\code{Fields}}{A list containing strings corresponding to the existing fields in the \code{humdrumR} object's
\link[=humTable]{humdrum table}.
The fields are divided into five categories: "Data", "Structure", "Interpretation", "Formal", and "Reference."}

\item{\code{Active}}{A \code{\link[rlang:quosure-tools]{rlang::quosure()}} expression which serves the default, "\link[=humActive]{active expression}" for
the dataset.}

\item{\code{LoadTime}}{A \link[base:DateTimeClasses]{POSIXct} value, indicating the time at which \code{\link[=readHumdrum]{readHumdrum()}} was
called to create this \code{humdrumR} object.}
