\description{
\code{humdrumR} is a toolkit for the analysis of data encoded in the \href{http://www.humdrum.org/guide/ch05/}{humdrum syntax}.
The humdrum syntax is an incredibly flexible, and powerful, scheme for encoding musical data.
Tens of thousands of musical scores (and other musical data) have been encoded in the humdrum syntax, many available online through repositories such as
\href{http://kern.ccarh.org/}{KernScores}.
}
\details{
\code{humdrumR} is intended as a modernized replacement for the original \href{http://www.humdrum.org/}{humdrum toolkit}, leveraging
the power of \code{R} to give us unprecedented power to manipulate and analyze humdrum data using concise, expressive syntax.

\section{Package design}{


The package \code{humdrumR} has seven main components:
\itemize{
\item To represent humdrum data in R, we have the \link[=humdrumRclass]{humdrumR} \href{http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html}{S4 class}, and it's core component
the \link[=humTable]{humdrum table}.
\item To create \code{humdrumR} data, a sophisticated humdrum data parser: \link{readHumdrum}.
\code{humdrumR} data can also be written back to humdrum-syntax text files using \link{writeHumdrum}.
\item To filter \code{humdrumR} data, we have the \code{\link[=subset.humdrumR]{subset.humdrumR()}} function, which can also be called
using \code{R}'s standard \link[base:Extract]{indexing operators}: \verb{[]} and \verb{[[]]}.
\item To manipulate and modify \code{humdrumR} data, we have the \link[=withinHumdrum]{with and within} methods for \code{humdrumR} objects.
\item To facilitate the development of functions to work with humdrum tokens---which are simple character strings packed with information---,
a useful API we call our \link[=humdrumDispatch]{regular-expression dispatch system}.
\item Several \link[=humdrumPitch]{modules} for representing and manipulating musical pitch information,
including our core \link{tonalInterval} class to represent tonal pitch.
\item A \link[=humRhythm]{module} for representing and manipulating musical rhythm information,
with a core \link{rhythmInterval} class to represent rhythms.
