\description{
\code{humdrumR} is a toolkit for the analysis of data encoded in the \href{http://www.humdrum.org/guide/ch05/}{humdrum syntax}.
The humdrum syntax is an incredibly flexible, and powerful, scheme for encoding musical data.
Tens of thousands of musical scores (and other musical data) have been encoded in humdrum, many available online, 
for instance at \href{http://kern.ccarh.org/}{KernScores}.
}
\details{
\code{humdrumR} is intended as a modernized replacement for the original \href{http://www.humdrum.org/}{humdrum toolkit}, levaraging
the power of R to give us enprecedented power to manipulate and analyze humdrum data using concise, expressive syntax.

\section{Package design}{

The package \code{humdrumR} has xx main components:
\enumerate{
\item To represent humdrum data in R, we have the \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} \emph{S4} class, and it's core
component the \code{\link[humdrumR:humTable]{Humdrum Table}}. 
\item To create \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} data, a sophisticated
humdrum data parser: \code{\link{readHumdrum}}. \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} data
can also be written back to humdrum-syntax text files using \code{\link{writeHumdrum}}.
\item To filter and "index" \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} data, we have the 
\code{\link{filterHumdrum}} function, which can also be called in a variety of 
short hands using \code{R}'s standard \code{\link[base:Extract]{indexing operators}}: \code{[]} and \code{[[]]}.
\item To manipulate and modify \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} data,
we have the \code{\link[humdrumR:with-in-Humdrum]{with(in)Humdrum}} and
\code{\link{humApply}} functions,
as well as the \code{\link[humdrumR:humPipe]{\%hum>\%}} operator which allows
us to use these commands in a pipe-line.
\item A set of "pipe" operators, so that \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} data can be 
manipulated and filtered in concise, bash-style pipe. 
\item To facilate the development of functions to work with humdrum tokens---which are simple
character strings packed with information---, a useful API we call a 
\code{\link[humdrumR:regexDispatch]{regular-expression dispatch system}}.
\item A \code{\link[humdrumR:humPitch]{module}} for representing and manipulating musical pitch information, 
with a core \code{\linkS4class{tonalInterval}} \emph{S4} class to represent pitch.
\item A \code{\link[humdrumR:humRhythm]{module}} for representing and manipulating musical rhythm information,
with a core \code{\linkS4class{rhythmInterval}} \emph{S4} class to represent rhythm.
