\description{
A toolkit for the analysis of humdrum data.
}
\section{Package design}{

The package \code{humdrumR} has xx main components:
\enumerate{
\item To represent humdrum data in R, we have the \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} \emph{S4} class, and it's core
component the \code{\link[humdrumR:humtable]{Humdrum Table}}. 
\item To create \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} data, a sophisticated
humdrum data parser: \code{\link{readHumdrum}}.
\item To manipulate and modify \code{\linkS4class{humdrumR}} data,
we have the \code{\link[humdrumR:with-in-Humdrum]{with(in)Humdrum}} functions,
as well as the \code{\link[humdrumR:humPipe]{\%hum>\%}} operator which allows
us to use these commands in a pipe-line.
\item To facilate the development of functions to work with humdrum tokens---which are simple
character strings packed with information---, a useful API we call a 
\code{\link[humdrumR:regexDispatch]{regular-expression dispatch system}}.
\item A module for representing and manipulating musical pitch information, 
with a core \code{\linkS4class{tonalInterval}} \emph{S4} class to represent pitch.
\item A module for representing and manipulating musical rhythm information,
with a core \code{\linkS4class{recip}} \emph{S4} class to represent rhythm.
