\title{The "selected" fields of a \link[=humdrumRclass]{humdrumR object}}
\usage{
selectedFields(humdrumR)

\method{select}{humdrumR}(.data, ...)
}
\description{
Every \code{humdrumR} object will have, at any given time, one or more of its
fields "selected."
Selected fields are show in the console printout.
The first selected field is also passed as the hidden \code{.} variable in calls to \code{with}, \code{within},
\code{mutate}, \code{summarize}, or \code{reframe}.
}
\details{
The currently selected fields are shown when a \link[=humdrumRclass]{humdrumR object} prints on the console.
At the bottom of the printout, the selected fields are also marked by an \code{*}.
The currently selected fields can also be queried directly using the \code{selectedFields()} function.
The selected fields can be set by calls to the tidyverse \code{select()} function.
As a shorthand, the keywords \code{"Data"}, \code{"Structure"}, \code{"Interpretation"}, \code{"Reference"}, or \code{"Formal"} can
be used to select \emph{all} fields of each \link[=fields]{field types}.

The selected fields play an important role in defining/redefining "null" data.
Whenever new fields are selected, they are checked for \code{NA} values or null
tokens---\code{"."}, \code{"*"}, \code{"!"}, or \code{"="}---and the \code{Null} structural field is set to \code{TRUE}
wherever they appear.
The \code{Type} field is also set to \code{"d"} wherever \code{Null == TRUE & Type == 'D'}.
If more than one field is selected, all fields must be null to be marked as such.
