\title{Onset/Offset interval since beginning.}
\usage{
SOI(durations, start = 0L)
}
\arguments{
\item{durations}{A vector of numeric values representing durations.}

\item{start}{A duration value (coerced to same class as \code{durations}), from which the
offset begins.}
}
\value{
A S3 object of class \code{"rhythmOffset"}, which
is essentially a data.frame with two columns---\code{Onset} and \code{Offset}---
of numeric values of the same class as the input \code{durations} argument.
}
\description{
Refers to a duration of rhythmic time elapsed since a starting point (usually, the beginning
of a piece).
In \code{music21} these are described as "offsets"---however,
we prefer to reserve the words "onset" and "offset" to refer
to the beginning (attacK) and end (release) of rhythmic events.
\code{STO} takes a vector of numbers representing durations
(numeric values) and cummulatively sums them from a starting value.
Unlike \code{\link[=sigma]{sigma()}}, \code{SOI} returns both the timestamp of the onset of
each rhythmic duration \emph{and} the offset.
\code{SOI} interprets the first duration as starting at zero---or a different
value specified by the \code{start} argument.
