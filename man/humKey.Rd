\description{
\code{diatonicKey} is one of \code{\link[humdrumR:humdrumR]{humdrumR}}'s 
\code{\link[humdrumR:humTonality]{types of tonal data}}, representing Western diatonic keys.
A key is represented by two integers, \code{Tonic} and \code{Mode}.
Tonic is simply the tonic note of the key on the circle of fifths.
Mode is a value between 0 and 6 on the circle of fifths, indicating the diatonic mode:
\itemize{
\item 0 = Lydian
\item 1 = Major (Ionian)
\item 2 = Mixolydian
\item 3 = Dorian
\item 4 = Minor (Aeolian)
\item 5 = Phyrgian
\item 6 = Locrian
