\arguments{
\item{x}{(atomic vector) The \code{x} argument can be any (\link[base:vector]{atomic}) vector, or a \link[=tonalIntervalS4]{tonalInterval}, or \code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{These arguments are passed to the \link[=pitchDeparsing]{pitch deparser}.
There are also two hidden (advanced) argumens you can specify: \code{memoize} and \code{deparse} (see the details below).}

\item{generic}{(logical, length 1) If \code{generic = TRUE} the "specific" pitch information is discarded.
For tonal representations, this means no accidentals/qualities or equivalent information is printed.
For atonal representations, the generic pitch is returned.
As an alternative, you can specify \code{specific} as an alternative (opposite) to the \code{generic} argument: \code{generic == !specific}.}

\item{simple}{(logical, length 1) If \code{simple = TRUE} the "complex" pitch information is discarded.
This means that \emph{octave} information is discarded, and the resulting output is confined within the default octave.
For absolute pitch representations, this is the octave above middle C.
For relative pitch representations, this is the octave above a unison.
(The special \code{octave.round} argument can be used to modify this behavior).}

\item{parseArgs}{(list) \code{parseArgs} can be a list of arguments that are passed to the \link[=tonalInterval]{pitch parser}.
As a convenient syntactic sugar, instead of writing \code{parseArgs = list(a = x, b = y, etc.)}, you can write
\code{parse(a = x, b = y, etc.)}.}

\item{transposeArgs}{(list) \code{transposeArgs} can be a list of arguments that are passed to a special call to \link{transpose}.
As a convenient syntactic sugar, instead of writing \code{transposeArgs = list(a = x, b = y, etc.)}, you can write
\code{transpose(a = x, b = y, etc.)}.}

\item{inPlace}{(logical, length 1) This argument only has an effect if the input (the \code{x} argument) is \code{character} strings,
\emph{and} there is extral, non-pitch information in the strings "beside" the pitch information.
If so, and \code{inPlace = TRUE}, the output will be placed into an output string beside the original non-pitch information.
If \code{inPlace = FALSE}, only the pitch output information will be returned (details below).}
}
\value{
\code{NULL} inputs (\code{x} argument) return a \code{NULL} output.
Otherwise, returns a vector of the same length as \code{x}.
\code{NA} values in the input \code{x} are propagated to the output.
}
\description{
These functions can be used to "translate" or otherwise modify data representing pitch information.

\section{In-place parsing}{


In humdrum data, character strings are often encoded with multiple pieces of musical information right besides each other:
for example, \verb{**kern} data might include tokens like \verb{"4.ee-[}.
The \code{humdrumR} parser (\code{tonalInterval}) will automatically "pull out" pitch information from within strings, if it can find any
using the appropriate known regular expressions.
For example, \code{pitch('4.ee-[')} returns Eb5.
However, all the pitch functions (like \code{\link[=pitch]{pitch()}} and \code{\link[=kern]{kern()}}) have an option to keep the "extra" information
and return the result "in place"---i.e., embedded right where it was found in the input string.
This is controlled with the \code{inPlace} argument, which is \code{FALSE} by default.
So, \code{pitch('4.ee-[', inPlace = TRUE)} will return 4.Eb5[---keeping the \code{"4."} and the \code{"["}.
(This obviously only works if the input is a string, not a numeric!)
Note that \code{inPlace = TRUE} will force functions like \code{semit}, which normally return numeric values, to return character strings
\emph{if} their input is a character string.
