\description{
\link[humdrumR:humdrumR]{humdrumR} includes a number of intertwined data structures, and associated functions, for representing and manipulating musical pitch information.
}
\section{Tonality}{


There are four data types extensively used in \code{humdrumR} to encode/process \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality}{tonal} musical information:
\itemize{
\item \link[base:integer]{integers} --- used to encode "\link{line-of-fifths}" tonal information
\item \link{tonalInterval} --- embeds line-of-fifth tonal integers alongside \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave}{octave} and \href{"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music)"}{cent} information to encode most tonal pitch representations (solfege, intervals, letternames, etc.)
\item \link{diatonicSet} --- combines line-of-fifth tonal integer representations to represent diatonic tonality, including alterations of basic diatonic scale(s).
\item \link{tertianSet} --- an extension of \code{diatonicSet} used to encode  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertian}{tertian} diatonic harmonies.
}

For a detailed explanation of the theory and specifics of \code{humdrumR}'s treatment of tonality, see the \emph{Tonality in humdrumR} vignette.

\section{Atonality}{


\strong{THIS SECTION IS INCOMPLETE}

In addition, there are xxx data types used to encode non-tonal (or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonality}{atonal}) pitch information.
\itemize{
\item \link[base:integer]{integers} --- used to encode \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone}{semitones} (as well as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI}{MIDI} numbers).
\item \link{xxx} --- sets?
\item \link{xxx} --- 12-tone rows?
