\usage{
LO5th(x, generic = FALSE, ...)
}
\value{
Returns an integer vector or array, matching the input.

\description{
The function \code{LO5th} is a S3-generic function with methods to extract
the "line-of-fifths" value from various pitch objects and representations.

\details{
\subsection{The Line of Fifths}{

Every interval in Western music is associated with a integer on the line of fifths:
\itemize{
\item Bb = m7 = -2
\item F =  P4  = -1
\item C =  P1 = 0
\item G =  P5 = 1
\item D =  M2 = 2
\item A =  M6 = 3
\item E =  M3 = 4
\item B =  M7 = 5
\item F# = A4 = 6
\item etc.
}

The natural notes of (C) major scale---which we also call the \emph{generic intervals}---fall in the range \code{-1:5}.
In fact, any diatonic key is a block of seven consecutive numbers of the line-of-fifths: for example, Eb major is \code{-4:2}.
"Sharps" and "flats" represent \code{+7} or \code{-7} on the line-of-fifths respectively.
}
}
\seealso{
\code{LO5th}s are a core component of the \link{tonalIntervalS4} representation, and are thus
an argument to the \code{tonalInterval} constructor: \link[=tint]{tint(octave, LO5th)}.
Also, see the \link{tonalInterval} function, which is used by many \code{LO5th} methods.
