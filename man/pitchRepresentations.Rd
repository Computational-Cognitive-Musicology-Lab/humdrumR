\section{Reading/Writing Atonal Pitch Information}{


Atonal pitch representations predefined in \code{humdrumR} include \code{semit}, \code{midi}, \code{frequency}, \code{ratio}, and \code{fraction}.
As mentioned above, \code{integer} inputs are interpreted as semitones while \code{numeric} are interpreted as frequency ratios.
\subsection{Interpreting Frequencies/Ratios}{

Four additional arguments help \code{humdrumR} determing how to interpret frequencies or ratios as \code{tonalInterval}s.
\itemize{
\item \code{tonalHarmonic}: This determines the assumed tuning system by specifying the "tonal frequency ratio" associated
with an interval of a perfect 12th.
The default is \code{3}, corresponding to pythagorean tuning; change it to \code{2^(19/12)} to use equal temeperament.
\item \code{centMargin}: this numeric argument determines how close \code{humdrumR} tries to get (in cents) to the input ratio (default is 10 cents).
If the \code{centMargin} is low, \code{humdrumR} may give you a crazy accidental like \verb{A----} to get very close to the input ratio.
If the \code{centMargin} is higher, \code{humdrumR} will give the most reasonable (fewest accidentals) \code{tonalInterval} within that margin.
For example, \code{as.tonalInterval(1.44, centMargin = 10)} will return E##, because a pythagorean E## is within 10 cents of the ratio \code{1.44}.
However, \code{as.tonalInterval(1.44, centMargin = 20)} will return the more resonable \code{F#}.
\item \code{frequency.reference} and \code{frequencyTint}: these arguments determing what the reference frequency and note is for
when reading frequencies. The standard A = 440Hz corresponds to \verb{(frequency.reference = 440, frequencyTint = as.tonalInterval('a'))}.

\subsection{Tonal Decisions}{

When interpreting an atonal reprsentation as a tonal one there are multiple possibilities (for instance, midi note 61 could
be C# or Db).
The process \code{humdrumR} uses to determine the tonal representation of atonal input is influenced by the \code{accidental.melodic} and
\code{Key} arguments:
By default (\code{Key == NULL & accidental.melodic == FALSE}), the line-of-fifths range -3--8 (E flat to G sharp) is used.
However, if a \code{Key} argument is specified, this line-of-fifths range will be shifted to match the corresponding key signature.
For instance, the key Bb minor would read accidentals in the range -8--3 (Fb flat to A natural).
If \code{accidental.melodic == TRUE}) the atonal notes are interpreted "melodically"---i.e.,
ascending chromatic steps as sharps and descending chromatic steps as flats.
When reading frequencies/ratios, a "pure" \code{tonalHarmonic} value---like the pure \code{3} of pythagorean tuning---will help determine
the appropriate accidental.
However, equal temperament will not provide useful information, so the \code{Key} and \code{accidental.melodic} arguments can be used instead.
