\title{Pitch representations and translations}
\description{
These functions translate various pitch representations
between each other. Using the \code{humdrumR} \code{\link[humdrumR:regexDispatch]{regular-expression dispatch system}}
they will even (automatically) read parts of a string which represent a pitch,
and translate only that part (leaving the rest of the string unchanged).
They all have an option \code{inPlace} which can be set to \code{FALSE}
if you want them to discard non-pitch parts of the string(s).
}
\details{
Under the hood, these functions use the \code{\link{humdrumR}}
\code{\link[humdrumR:tonalInterval]{tonalInterval}} \code{S4} class as the
fundamental, \emph{lingua franca} representation of pitch.
