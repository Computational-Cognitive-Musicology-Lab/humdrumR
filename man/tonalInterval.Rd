\description{
The \code{tonalInterval} is the core tonal pitch representation in \link[=humdrumR]{humdrumR}.
A \code{tonalInterval} is an abstract representation of tonal pitch, which can be translated to/from all standard "concrete" pitch representations:
solfege, scientific pitch, semitones, frequencies, scale degrees, intervals, etc.
For the most part, users should not need to interact with \code{tonalInterval}s directly---rather, \code{tonalInterval}s work behind the scene in numerous \code{humdrumR} pitch functions.
See the \link{pitchRepresentations} and \link{tonalTransformations} documentation for details of usage and functionality or the \emph{Tonality in humdrumR} vignette for
a detailed explanation of the theory and specifics of \code{tonalInterval}s.
}
\details{
The \code{tonalInterval} is a \href{http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html}{S4} subclass of \code{humdrumR}'s virtual class \link{struct}, from which it inherits a lot of useful "vector-like" behaviors/functionality.

The constructor function \code{tint} can be used to create \code{tonalIntervals} directly.
The three arguments corespond to the three slots: \code{octave}, \code{LO5th} (Fifth), and \code{cent}.
All inputs will be coerced to match in length.
What's more, the \code{octave} argument can be left blank, in which case the appropriate octave will automatically be computed
to place the interval in the octave above middle-C.

By default, the \link[base:character]{as.character} method, and thus (via \link{struct}) the \link[methods:show]{show} method, for \code{tonalInterval}s call \link[=pitchRepresentations]{kern()}.
Thus, if you return a \code{tonalInterval} on the command line (or call \link[base:print]{print} one one) you'll see the \link[=pitchRepresentations]{kern pitch} representation printed.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{Octave}}{integers representing the octave offset.}

\item{\code{Fifth}}{integers representing the "line-of-fifths" value.}

\item{\code{Cent}}{numeric values representing cents (1200th of an octave).
\subsection{Arithmetic}{

Technically, \code{tonalInterval}s are examples of algebraic \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)}{modules over integers}.
This means that certain arithmetic operations are defined for \code{tonalIntervals} and can be called using standard arithmetic operators (\code{+}, \code{-}, etc.):
\itemize{
\item Addition: \code{tonalIntervals} can be added together, acting exactly as you'd expect (i.e., \eqn{M3 + m3 = P5}).
\item Subtraction: \code{tonalIntervals} can be subtracted just as they are added. Also, they can be negated with a single \code{-}
operator (like \code{-M3}).
\item Multiplication: \code{tonalInterval}s can \emph{not} be multiplied together.
However, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication}{scalar (integer) multiplication} is defined:
thus, \code{tonalIntervals} can be multiplied by integers to create new \code{tonalInterval}s: e.g., \eqn{M2 * 3L = A4}.
\item Division: as the natural inverse of scale multiplication, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division}{Euclidean division}
is defined for \code{tonalIntervals}---i.e., division by/into whole (integer) pieces, often with leftover "remainders" (modulo).
In R, Euclidean division is achieved with the \link[base:Arithmetic]{\%/\%} operator---\emph{not} \code{/}---, with the associated \link[base:Arithmetic]{\%\%} used for the remainder/modulo.
Two \code{tonalInterval}s can be divided to produced an integer; Conversely, a \code{tonalInterval} can be divided by an integer to produce a \code{tonalInterval}.
}

Take note that the way \code{humdrumR} defines Euclidean division is based in \emph{tonal space}---i.e., the line-of-fifths---not frequency or atonal-semitone space.
For example, an augmented-fourth divided by a major-second \emph{is} \code{3L}, but a diminished-fifth divided by a major-second is \emph{not} 3L---\code{d5 \%/\% M2} equals \code{-3L} with a remainder of \code{P8} (plus an octave)!
The division algorithm works by applying standard Euclidean division to the \verb{@Fifth} slot (line-of-fifths tonal space), and shifting the \verb{@Octave} value in
the remainder to the match the appropriate octave.
This definition has the useful properties that \code{specificinterval \%\% A1 = genericinterval} and \code{interval \%\% d2 = enharmonicinterval}.
}

\subsection{Relational Operators}{

\code{tonalInterval}s can be compared using the standard \link[base:Comparison]{relational operations}---\code{==}, \code{!=}, \code{>}, \code{>=}, etc.
Two \code{tonalInterval}s are equal (according to \code{==}) only if all their slots (\code{Octave}, \code{Fifth}, and \code{Cent})
are exactly identical.
Thus, enharmonic notes (like C# and Db) are \emph{not} equal.
In contrast, ordinal comparisons (e.g., \code{>}, \code{<=}) between \code{tonalInterval}s are based on their semitone (equal temperament) size, so enharmonicity is irrelevant.
Thus, \code{m3 >= A2} and \code{A2 >= m3} are both \code{TRUE}, even though \code{m3 == A2} is not.
}

\subsection{Coercion}{

\code{humdrumR} knows how to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion}{coerce} several \link[base:vector]{base-R atomic types} into \code{tonalInterval}s.
This can be done using the \link[methods:as]{as} function---e.g., \code{as(3, "tonalInterval")}---or more intuitively using the function \code{tonalInterval()}.
Coercision methods are defined for
\itemize{
\item \link[base:integer]{integer}: interpreted as semitones
\item \link[base:numeric]{numeric}: interpreted as frequency ratios, assuming a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning}{Pythagorean tuning}.
\item \link[base:character]{character}: interpreted using \code{humdrumR}s \link[=regexDispatch]{regular expression dispatch system}, as
explained fully \link[=pitchRepresentations]{here}.
}

Since, coersion is defined, \code{tonalInterval} arithmatic can be applied when one of the two arguments is a \code{tonalInterval} and the other is a coercable atomic.
For instance, \code{M3 + 2L} will interpret \code{2L} as two semitones and add a major-second to the major-third!
The clever \link[=regexDispatch]{dispatch system} will even ignore character strings that are not recognized (see examples)!
}

\subsection{Predefined Intervals:}{

\code{humdrumR} automatically exports a bunch of \code{tonalInterval}s, named by their musical interval representation.
Every generic interval from 1 to 15 is combined with every interval quality \code{dd} (doubly diminished), \code{d} (diminished), \code{m} (minor), \code{M} (major), \code{A} (augumented)
\code{AA} (doubly augmented).
Thus, after loading \code{humdrumR}, you can type things like \code{M3 + M3} and get \code{A5}.
In addition, the variables \code{unison} (\verb{= P1 = tint(0, 0)}),  \code{pythagorean.comma} (\verb{= d2 = tint(-19,12)}), and \code{octave} (\code{tint(1, 0)}) are exported as well.
