\title{"Fold" exclusive interpretations into new fields}
\usage{
foldExclusive(humdrumR, fold, onto, fromField = activeFields(humdrumR)[1])
}
\arguments{
\item{humdrumR}{A \link[=humdrumR-class]{humdrumR data object}.}

\item{fold}{(\code{character}) The target exclusive interpretation(s) \emph{from which}
to "fold" spines to new fields.
Must be specified \emph{without} the \verb{**} prefix: \code{"kern"} not \code{"**kern"}.}

\item{onto}{(\code{character}, whole number) The target exclusive interpretation(s) \emph{to which}
the "fold" data is moved.
Must be specified \emph{without} the \verb{**} prefix: \code{"kern"} not \code{"**kern"}.}

\item{fromField}{(\code{character}, \code{length == 1}) A string (partially) matching the
name of a data field in the \code{humdrumR}-object input. This field is the field which is
"folded" to a new field.}
}
\description{
\code{foldExclusive()} is a special version of \code{\link[=foldHumdrum]{foldHumdrum()}}, which
"folds" spines based on their exclusive interpretations.
For instance, we can "fold" all the \verb{**silbe} spines in a corpus
onto their respective \verb{**kern} spines.
}
\details{
The \code{fold} and \code{onto} arguments (\code{character}, \code{length == 1})
must match exclusive interpretations in the \code{humdrumR} object input.
Within each file, mismatches in the number of matching \code{onto} and \code{fold} spines
are handled "in parallel," just like \code{\link[=foldHumdrum]{foldHumdrum()}}.
Multi-matching spines are matched from left-to-right.

If no matching exclusive interpetation pairs are found,
the unchanged \code{humdrumR} object is returned with a warning.

\code{foldExclusive} makes use of the more general \code{\link[=foldHumdrum]{foldHumdrum()}}.
