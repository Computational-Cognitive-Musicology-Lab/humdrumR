\title{Expand numbers outwards from zero}
\usage{
expand(x)
}
\description{
Expand is a complement to the base \code{R} \link[base:Round]{rounding functions}, particularly \code{trunc}.
}
\details{
Each of the four base \code{R} functions---\code{round}, \code{ceiling}, \code{floor}, and \code{trunc}---follow
a different logic in how they round real numbers to ingegers:
\itemize{
\item \code{round}: round to \emph{nearest} integer in either direction.
\item \code{floor}: round downward \emph{towards negative infinity}.
\itemize{
\item Negative numbers are rounded to "more negative" numbers.
}
\item \code{ceiling}: round upward \emph{towards infinity}.
\itemize{
\item Negative numbers are rounded to "less negative" numbers.
}
\item \code{trunc}: round "inward" \emph{towards} zero.
\itemize{
\item Negative numbers are rounded \emph{up} to "less negative" numbers, but positive
numbers are still rounded downwards to "less positive" numbers.
}
}

Just as \code{ceiling} compliments \code{floor}, the \code{humdrumR} function \code{expand} acts
as a compliment to \code{trunc}: \code{expand} rounds "outward" \emph{away from zero}.
Negative numbers are rounded to "more negative" numbers and positive numbers
are rounded to "more positive" numbers.

A table explains better than words:\tabular{ll}{
   Call \tab Returns \cr
   \code{  round(c(2.9, 3.1, -2.9, -3.1))} \tab \code{c(3, 3, -3, -3)} \cr
   \code{  floor(c(2.9, 3.1, -2.9, -3.1))} \tab \code{c(2, 3, -3, -4)} \cr
   \code{ceiling(c(2.9, 3.1, -2.9, -3.1))} \tab \code{c(3, 4, -2, -3)} \cr
   \code{  trunc(c(2.9, 3.1, -2.9, -3.1))} \tab \code{c(2, 3, -2, -3)} \cr
   \code{ expand(c(2.9, 3.1, -2.9, -3.1))} \tab \code{c(3, 4, -3, -4)} \cr
}
}
