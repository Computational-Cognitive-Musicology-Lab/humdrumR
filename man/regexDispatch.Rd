\description{
The \code{\link{humdrumR}} \strong{regular-expression method dispatch}
system is a simple system for making new functions which can by smartly
applied to complex character strings.
}
\details{
The function \code{do2RE} accepts and arbitrary function
and a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression}{regular expression} (regex)
and makes a new function that applies the original function only to
any part of a string which matches the regex.

The function \code{regexDispatch} accepts a list
of functions, each with a matching regular expression,
and creates a new function which applies whichever function
based on which regexs it finds in its input.
