Nat's ToDo:
	Rethink relationship beween Piece and File field.

	Add grace slot to rhythmInterval?



Minor:
	Make time signatures using "0" and "00" as denominators work? Maybe some other way of reading mensuration?

	Add ordering options to gamut(), so you could order by LO5th, for example.

	Add arguument to withHumdrum that causes short results to be filled to the right.

	Remove names from output vector in return from with(..., drop =TRUE)

Bugs:
	Figured bass not working with keys?
	key('k[f#]') not working
	key('I', Key = 'A:') not working?


Questions:
	Should collapse and sep be distinct arguments (to some functions), or one argument like in base::paste()?
