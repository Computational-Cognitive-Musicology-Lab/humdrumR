Nat's ToDo:
	Rethink relationship beween Piece and File field.

	Add grace slot to rhythmInterval?

	Add "skip" functionality to mint() and hint()


Major:
	Allow with to return matrices!
		What about doing autocorrelation with [lag = 0:10]?

	humtab[ , rlang::eval_tidy(doQuo, data = .SD), by = ...] is slow

Minor:
	Make time signatures using "0" and "00" as denominators work? Maybe some other way of reading mensuration?

	Add ordering options to gamut(), so you could order by LO5th, for example.

	Remove names from output vector in return from with(..., drop =TRUE)

	hop()
		add hop.matrix and hop.data.frame
		add support for negative indexing.


Bugs:
	Figured bass not working with keys?
	key('k[f#]') not working
	key('I', Key = 'A:') not working?



Questions:
	Should collapse and sep be distinct arguments (to some functions), or one argument like in base::paste()?
