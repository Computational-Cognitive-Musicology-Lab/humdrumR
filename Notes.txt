Nat's ToDo:
	Rethink relationship beween Piece and File field.

	Add grace slot to rhythmInterval?

Features:


	Windowing


Windowing:
	open		close
	prev.open + x	open + x
	prev.open + x	next.open + x
	prev.close + x	open + x


	identify "anchors" in vector
		could be regex matches
		could be numeric sequences

	Pick open anchors independently	
	Pick open anchors dependtly
		dependent on closes
		dependent on previous open/closes

	ditto for close
	


Minor:
	Make time signatures using "0" and "00" as denominators work? Maybe some other way of reading mensuration?

	Add ordering options to gamut()

	Remove names from output vector in return from with(..., drop =TRUE)

Bugs:
	Figured bass not working with keys?
	key('k[f#]') not working
	key('I', Key = 'A:') not working?


Questions:
	Should collapse and sep be distinct arguments (to some functions), or one argument like in base::paste()?
