Welcome to "Getting started with humdrumR"!
This document will introduce you the basics of humdrumR, so that you can start doing simple analyses of humdrum data.
(If you aren't sure what humdrumR is or what it can do, checkout the [Overview of humdrumR](Overview.html "Overview of humdrumR") before trying to get started.)
This tutorial is aimed at novice or even non-programmers---if you are already a strong coder and want to move things a long a little faster, checkout the [humdrumR for coders](IntroForCoders.html "humdrumR for coders") tutorial instead.

This vignette closely parallels information in `humdrumR`'s code documentation;
within an R session, you can find more concise versions of the material in this document by calling:

```{r}
library(humdrumR)

?humdrumR

```

## Quick Start

Let's just dive right in!
First, make sure humdrumR is installed: [how to install humdrumR](https://github.com/Computational-Cognitive-Musicology-Lab/humdrumR "Getting humdrumR from github").  
Open an R session and load the humdrumR library using the command `library(humdrumR)`---now you are ready to rock!

HumdrumR comes packaged with a small number of humdrum data files just for you to play around with.
These files are stored in the directory where your computer installed humdrumR, in a subfolder called "HumdrumData".
You can move your R session to this folder using R's "set working directory command": `setwd(humdrumRroot)`.
Once you're in the humdrumR directory, you can use the base R `dir` function to see what humdrum data is available to you.

```{r}
library(humdrumR)

setwd(humdrumRroot)

dir('HumdrumData')

```


It looks like there are `r humdrumR:::num2word(length(dir('HumdrumData')))` folders of humdrum data available to you.
Using `dir` again, we can look inside one: let's start with the 'BachChorales' folder.

```{r}

dir('HumdrumData/BachChorales')

```


There are `r humdrumR:::num2word(length(dir('HumdrumData/BachChorales')))` files in the folder, named "chor001.krn", "chor002.krn", etc.
These are simple plain humdrum text files, using the '**kern' interpretation to represent ten chorales by J.S. Bach.
Take a minute to find the files in your computer's finder/exporer and open them up with a simple text editor.
One of the core philosophies of humdrumR is that we maintain a direct, transparent relationship with our symbolic data---so always take the time to look at your data! 
You can also do this within Rstudio's "Files" pane---in fact, Rstudio will make things extra easy for you because you can (within the Files pane) click "More" > "Go To Working Directory" to quickly find the files.




### Reading humdrum data

Now that we've found some humdrum data to look at, let's read it into humdrumR.
We can do this useing humdrumR's `readHumdrum` command.
Try this:

```{r}

readHumdrum('HumdrumData/BachChorales/chor001.krn') -> chor1

```

This command does two things:

1. The `readHumdrum` function will read the "chor001.krn" file into R and create a humdrumR data object from it.
2. This new object will be saved to a variable called `chor1`. (The name 'chor1' is just a name I chose---you are welcome to give it a different name if you want.)

Once we've created our `chor1` object (or whatever you chose to call it), we can take a quick look at what it is by just typing its name on the command line and pressing enter:

```{r}

chor1

```

(In R, when you enter something on the command line, R "prints" it out for you to read.)
The print-out you see shows you the name of the file, the contents of the file, and some stuff about "Data fields" that you will learn about soon.

Cool! Still, looking at a single humdrum file is not really that exciting. 
The whole point of using computers is working with large amounts of data.
Luckily, humdrumR makes this very easy.
Check out this next command:

```{r}

readHumdrum('HumdrumData/BachChorales/chor0') -> chorales
```

Notice that all I've changed is that instead of writing `'chor001.krn'`, I wrote `'chor0'`.
When we feed the string `'chor0'` to `readHumdrum`, it won't just look for a file called "chor0"; it will read *any* file in that folder whose name contains the substring "chor0"---which in this case is all ten files!
Try printing the new `chorales` object to see how it is different.

```{r}

chorales

```

Wow! We've now got a "humdrumR corpus of `r humdrumR:::num2word(length(chorales)) ` files"---and that's nothing: `readHumdrum` will work just as well reading hundreds or thousands of files!
Notice that when you print humdrumR object, humdrumR shows you the beginning of the first file and the end of the last file, as well as telling you how many files there are in total.

`readHumdrum` has a number of other cool options which you can read about in more detail in our [humdrumR read/write tutorial](ReadWrite.html "Reading and writing data with humdrumR").




# The Data Model

To really make use of humdrumR, you need to understand a bit about how humdrum data is represented in the humdrumR package: the humdrumR "**data model**."

The essential thing to understand is how it maps between the [humdrum data syntax](https://humdrum.org) and a R data.table.

![](images/DataModelDiagram.png){width=600px}

To fully understand this, you should start with at least a basic understanding of the humdrum syntax! 
Read about the syntax at [humdrum.org](humdrum.org) or check out [our vignette]{HumdrumSyntax.html "The Humdrum Syntax"} on the topic.

## data.frames

Data.frames are essential to R.
A data.frame is simply a two-dimensional table of named columns.
Each column is either a vector or list of values, all of which are the same length.

HumdrumR makes use of a popular extension of base-R data.frames, the [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html).


In humdrumR, *every* single, individual token in a collection of humdrum-syntax text files is given its own row in a data.frame.
For example, consider this simple, humdrum-syntax file:


```{r echo=FALSE, results='none'}

ex1 <- readLines('examples/BasicExample.krn')

rest <- ex1[-1]
tokens <- c(ex1[1], unlist(strsplit(rest, split = '\t| ')))

##
ex1df <- as.data.frame(t(stringi::stri_list2matrix(strsplit(rest, '\t'))), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

cat(' ', sep = '', ex1[1], '\n')
apply(format.data.frame(ex1df, justify = 'left', width = 30), 1, 
      function(x) cat(' ', x, sep = '', '\n')) 


```

This file contains `r humdrumR:::num2word(length(tokens))` individual tokens.
To illustrate, here I'll print the same file, but with *each* token bracketed by `<` and `>`:

```{r echo = FALSE}

printquoted <- function(ex) {
quoted <- ex
    quoted[] <- lapply(quoted,
                   function(col) {
                       col <- strsplit(col, split = ' ')
                       col <- lapply(col,  function(x) paste0('<', x, '>'))
                       sapply(col, paste, collapse = ' ')
                       
                   })


cat('<', ex1[1], '>', '\n', sep ='')
apply(format.data.frame(quoted, justify = 'left', width = 30), 1, 
      function(x) cat(x, sep = '', '\n'))
    invisible(NULL)
}

printquoted(ex1df)

```

So what happens when `humdrumR` reads this file?
(This file is bundled with `humdrumR` in the `"humdrumRroot/examples"` directory.)

```{r}

example1 <- readHumdrum('examples/BasicExample.krn')

example1
```

We see the same thing we saw earlier, when we were reading real humdrum data from the `"HumdrumData"` folder.
But what's under the hood?
To see that, we can use the `getHumtab` function to extract the underlying humdrum table:



```{r}

humtab <- getHumtab(example1)

humtab

```


Look at that, a `data.table` with `r humdrumR:::num2word(nrow(humtab))` rows!
In this case, the humdrum data table ("humtable") has `r humdrumR:::num2word(ncol(humtab))` columns!
The columns are:

```{r}
colnames(humtab)

```

In `humdrumR`, we refer to these columns as **fields**.
To learn what fields are in a humdrumR object, it is better to call the `fields` command directly on the original `humdrumR` object:

```{r}
fields(example1)
```

We see that there are `r humdrumR:::num2word(ncol(humtab))` fields (humtable columns), and that they are divided into five types of fields: 

+ Data fields
+ Structure fields
+ Interpretation fields
+ Form fields
+ Reference fields

(A good place to read the details about what all the columns means is the `humTable` documentation you can get by calling `?humTable`.)


Let's go back to the Bach chorales dataset we loaded earlier (we saved it as `chorales`):

```{r}
fields(chorales)

```

The `chorales` corpus has `r nrow(fields(chorales))` fields!---all the same fields as `example1`, but some additional ones.
These additional fields are interpretation and reference records that didn't appear in our toy `example1`.

----

### Main Fields

The most important fields that are always present in a humdrumR humtable are 1) the "Token" field which contains the original `character` tokens read from the humdrum data!; and 2) the "Structural" fields which tell us where in the original humdrum data each token came from.
The "Structural" fields are what allow humdrumR to (re)construct the original humdrum data---translating between the humdrum-table (`data.table`) and the plain-text humdrum syntax.

We can inspect any field in our humdrumR data using the `$` operator: Just call your humdrumR data object with `$` and the name of a field.
Using this, we can see what the content of all those structural fields is!
The most important are the `Spine`, `Record`, (Record) `Type`, and `File(name)` fields.

```{r}

example1$Spine

# example1$Record

example1$Type

example1$Filename

```

The "record types" are:

+ `"G"`: global comment (including reference records)
+ `"L"`: local comment
+ `"I"`: interpretation
+ `"M"`: measure (i.e., barlines)
+ `"D"`: (non-null) data token
+ `"d"`: null data token (`"."`)


### Stops

In humdrum syntax, multiple tokens can be placed "in the same place" (i.e., same record, same spine) by simply separating them with spaces.
(This is most commonly used to represent chords in `**kern` data.)
In `humdrumR`, we call these "Stops"---as always, **every** humdrum token, including stops, get their own row in a humdrumR humtable.
Thus, we need the `Stop` field to tell us which stop a token came from!
In much data, all/most tokens are simply `Stop == 1` (the first position), but if there are more than one tokens in the same record/spine, they will be numbered ascending from one:

Let's look at an example to make sense of this!

```{r}

stops <- readHumdrum('examples/Stops.krn')

stops
```


Here we have a file with chords in the second spine: individual note tokens separated by spaces.
Let's inspect the humtable:

```{r}
getHumtab(stops)

```

You can see that each note of the chords gets its own row, numbered `1`, `2`, and `3` in the `Stop` field!



### Paths



Some humdrum data contains "spine paths"---places where a single spine splits into two.
`humdrumR` treats spine paths as "subspines" of the main spine which they split from, each one numbered in the `Path` field.
The starting path (leftmost) is numbered path `0`---in datasets with no spine paths, the `Path` field will be all zeros.
Other paths are numbered with higher integers.

Let's look at a simple example:

```{r}

paths1 <- readHumdrum('examples/Paths.krn')

paths1

paths1$Path

getHumtab(paths1)

```


Here is a more complex example:

```{r}

paths2 <- readHumdrum('examples/Paths2.krn')

paths2

paths2$Path

getHumtab(paths2)



```

Notice that `humdrumR` prints paths in a way that is more readable than reading humdrum syntax directly:
paths are "shifted" over into columns that align.
This is what the `Column` field is used for.




# Doing Stuff!

Ok, we've now seen how to read and inspect humdrumR data.
We've also got some idea of what the humdrum data looks like under the surface: the humdrum table.
What can we do with it?

When you create a `humdrumR` corpus object, using `readHumdrum`, this object encapsulates a humdrum-table (`data.table`) object, which is where the data is really stored.
We've already seen that you can extract that humdrum table directly using `getHumtab`---and if you are aleady an R pro, you might just want to extract the table an work with it directly.
However, what the `humdrumR` object does is give us some convenient ways of working with that table.
For example, we've already seen that when we print `humdrumR` objects, they print out as humdrum syntax, which is easier to read than the complex humdrum table!
But the `humdrumR` does more!

The main thing `humdrumR` does is allow us to work with the fields of our humdrum-tables in way that is convenient and powerful.
First, we create special "*do-expressions*" that refer to the humtable's fields.
To create these expression, we use the R `~` operator.
For instance, I can write things like:

+ `~ Spine + File`
+ `~ nchar(Token)`
+ `~ paste0(Token, Record)`

Notice that all three of these expressions contain the names of `humdrumR` fields.
If you execute these lines in an R session, nothing much will happen:
you'll see that they are saved---'quoted'---and returned as R `formula` objects.

```{r}

~ Spine + File

~ nchar(Token)

~ paste0(Token, Record)

```

However, we can tell `humdrumR` to evaluate these expressions using the fields of our humdrum tables.
These simplest way is using the `%hum>%` pipe operator, which takes a `humdrumR` object (on its left side), and a `formula` on its right side:


```{r}

chorales %hum>% ~ Spine + File

chorales %hum>% ~ nchar(Token)

chorales %hum>% ~ paste0(Token, Record)

```

Each expression is evaluated, and the result is put back in the same place in the humdrum data!
You'll also notice that in the printout, there is a new Data field, called `Pipe1`---this is the default name `humdrumR` assigns to new fields that you create.

If you want, you can pick your own names by using `$<-` (i.e., assigning to a new name you create using `$`).
For instance, lets use `humdrumR`'s `semits` function (see the [humdrum pitch](Pitch.html) vignette) to calculate the semitone value for each pitch in the chorales:

```{r}

chorales %hum>% ~ semits(Token)

```

It worked!
Lets do it again, but save the result in a new field, which we will call `Semits`---of course, you could give it any name you want, or just let it be called `Pipe1` if you want!

```{r}

chorales %hum>% ~ semits(Token) -> chorales$Semits

```

There is now a new Data field in our humdrum table, called `Semits`.
Meanwhile, the original `Token` field is still there, safely unchanged!
Just like before, we can use the `$` operator to look at our fields:

```{r}

chorales$Token

chorales$Semits

```

Whats more, we can use the `Semits` field *just* like any other field:

```{r}

chorales %hum>% ~ paste0(Token, ' = ', Semits)


```
