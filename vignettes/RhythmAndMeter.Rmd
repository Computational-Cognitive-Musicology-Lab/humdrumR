As a computational musicology toolkit, `r hm`'s tools for analyzing and manipulating pitch data are just about the most important tools in the toolbox.
For the most part, `r hm`'s pitch tools are focused on the Western notions of rhythm and meter, but the tools can easily be generalized to more diverse notions of rhythm and time.


# Durations

The fundamental unit of rhythm is a "duration"---a span of time.
`r Hm` defines a suite of rhythm functions, notably `recip()` and `duration()`.
These functions all work in essentially the same way: they take in an input argument and output rhythm (duration) information in their own particular format.
For example,

```{r}

input <- c('4.c', '8d', '4e', '2.g')

duration(input)
recip(input)
noteValue(input)
quarters(input)

```


Notice that the functions all recognize the rhythm part of these input tokens, ignoring the non-rhythm (pitch) information.
If you want to keep the non-rhythm part of your tokens, use the `inPlace` argument:

```{r}

input <- c('4.c', '8d', '4e', '2.g')

duration(input, inPlace = TRUE)
recip(input, inPlace = TRUE)
noteValue(input, inPlace = TRUE)
quarters(input, inPlace = TRUE)

```

The cool thing is that each of these functions can read any of the other function's output.
So you can do things like:

```{r}

recip(0.375)

recip("𝅘𝅥 𝅭 c")


quarters(0.375)

quarters("𝅘𝅥 𝅭 c")

```


----

The complete list of basic pitch functions is: 

```{r results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}

pfs <- rapply(humdrumR:::rhythmFunctions, 
                \(func) paste0('    + `', 
                                ifelse(humdrumR:::.names(func) == '', func, paste0(humdrumR:::.names(func))), 
                                '`', ifelse(humdrumR:::.names(func) == '', '', paste0(' (', func, ')'))), how = 'list')

pfs <- lapply(pfs, \(top) Map(\(name, pf) paste(c(paste0('  + *', name, ' duration representations*'), pf), collapse = '\n'), names(top), top))

pfs <- Map(\(name, l) paste(c(paste0('+ **', name, ' duration representations**'), unlist(l)), collapse ='\n'), names(pfs), pfs)
cat(unlist(pfs), sep = '\n')


```

#### Documentation

The global documentation for *all* the rhythm functions can be seen by calling `?rhythmFunctions`.
You can also call documentation for any individual function, like `?recip`.


### Rhythm Arguments

The rhythm functions from the previous section have a few shared arguments that they *all* understand: `scale` and `parse(unit)`.

### Scale and Unit

The `scale` and `parse(unit)` arguments are conceptually different, but can be used to acheive very similar transformations, so it can be easy to confuse them.
The `scale` argument is the easiest to understand: it simply (re)scales the output duration of the function.
Would you like to [augment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_(music)) durations? Perhaps doubling their length?
Simply specify `scale = 2`.

```{r}

recip(c('8','4','4.','2'), scale = 2)

```


Or maybe you'd like [diminish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminution) the durations, by cutting them in thirds?

```{r}

recip(c('8','4','4.','2'), scale = 1/3)

```

---

The `unit` argument can be passed to the rhythm input parser by adding and argument `parse(unit = ...)` to a call.
Rather than transforming the output, this argument controls how the parser interprets the input unit.
This is most useful with numeric values.
I might get a bunch of duration values as numbers, like `c(1, 1.5, 2, 1, 0.5, 1)`.
But what unit is these numbers counting?
By default, `r hm` treats them as *whole notes*, so `0.5` is a half note, right?
However, we might prefer to think of these numbers as units of quarter notes---a very common approach.
Let's look at how our output would change:

```{r}

input <- c(1, 1.5, 2, 1, 0.5, 1)

recip(input)
recip(input, parse(unit = '4'))


```

As you can see, you could achieve the same difference in output using the `scale` argument (`scale = 1/4`), but the `unit` argument is a little bit of a different way of thinking about it.

## Special Cases

### IOI

In `**kern` data, some durations correspond to *rests* in the music, rather than notes, indicated by an `"r"`.
In many analyses, we want to ignore rests and just consider the durations (timespans) between notes, ignoring the presence of rests.
These are called *inter-onset-intervals*, or IOIs.
The `ioi()` function can be used to convert duration data that includes rests, into IOIs.
For example:

```{r}

melody <- c('8g','8f#', '8g', '8r', '8g', '8f#','8e','8d', '4d#', '8r', '8f#', '4b', '4r')


ioi(melody)
```

What did this do?

1. The duration of each rest is append to the duration of the previous non-rest (if any).
  + The first `8g` becomes a `4g`
  + The `4d#` becomes `4.d#`.
2. Rests are replaced by null tokens (`"."`).
3. The last note even is `NA`, because there is no more onsets after it to create a inter-*onset*-interval.

The last step here makes conceptual sense, but may not be what you want! 
Maybe you'd like the interval between the last onset and the *end* of the data?
For that, specify `finalOnset = TRUE`:

```{r}

ioi(melody, finalOnset = TRUE)
```

When used in a call to `with()` or `within()`, `ioi()` will automatically be applied within Files/Spines/Paths.

### Ties

A similar case to inter-onset-intervals are *ties*.
In `**kern`, the `[`, `_`, and `]` tokens are used to indicate groups of durations that are actually played as a single, longer duration.
The `untie()` function will automatically sum the durations of tied notes:


```{r}


melody <- c('[2d', '8d]', '8d', '8f#', '8g#', '4.a', '[8b-', '2b-_', '4b-]', '4a', '2g#')

untie(melody)

```

The tie tokens are removed, and tied-notes are replaced by null tokens (`"."`).

# Timeline

Traditional musical scores, and most humdrum data, encode rhythmic information as duration, like what we worked on in the previous section.
However, we often want to think about when musical events are happening, relative to a fixed reference: usually, relative to the beginning of the piece.
We can compute a *timeline* from sequences of duration values, using the `timeline()` function.

Let's say we have a melody like:

```{r}

row <- c('4c', '4c', '6c', '12d', '4e', '6e','12d', '6e', '12f', '2g', 
         '12cc', '12cc', '12cc', '12g', '12g', '12g', '12e', '12e', '12e', '12c', '12c', '12c', 
         '6g','12f', '6e', '12d','2c')

```

Let's look at a timeline for that melody:

```{r}


timeline(row)

```

The first note (`4c`) occurs at zero (the beginning) of the timeline; the last note (`2c`) lands `3.5` whole-notes later; etc.
If we combine this with a call to `semits()` (check out the [Pitch and Tonality][PitchAndTonality.html] guide) we can even make a plot of the melody:

```{r}

plot(x = timeline(row),
     y = semits(row, Exclusive = 'kern'),
     main = 'Row Row Row Your Boat')

```

---

The `timeline()` function has extra special functionality when working on actual humdrum datasets using `with()` or `within()`.
It will automatically (unless told not too) calculate timelines separately within each File/Spine/Path of a dataset, ignoring multiple stops.
For example:

```{r}
chorales <- readHumdrum(humdrumRroot, 'HumdrumData/BachChorales/chor.*.krn')

within(chorales, timeline(Token))


```

## Controlling the Start

You'll notice that our timelines all start with zero, which makes sense of course.
But in some cases, you might want to have the timeline start at a different value.
For example, "Row Row Row Your Boat" is a round, so we'd want the second entrance of the round to start at the second measure.
We can do this with the `start` argument to timeline:

```{r}
timeline(row, start = 2)


```

----

### Pickups

The `pickup` argument gives us another option to control where our timeline starts.
In many datasets, the first few events in the music are a *anacrusis* or "pick up"; we'd generally like our timeline to start *after* the pickup.
To make this happen, the `pickup` argument can be passed a `logical` vector which is the same length as the input (`x`): 
Any `TRUE` values at the beginning of the vector are considered a pickup;
Thus, the *first* `FALSE` value in the `pickup` vector is chosen as the start of th timeline.
For example, let's say we have the melody

```{r}
melody <- c('8c', '8d','2e', '2f','1e')

```

but the first two notes are a pickup.
Since we can see that the pickup has a duration of `.25` (quarte-note), we *could* use the `start` argument to do this:

```{r}
timeline(melody, start = -.25)


```

Now `0` is on the downbeat, and events before that `start` are negative on the timeline!

To do this with the `logical` `pickup` argument, we could do this:

```{r}
timeline(melody, pickup = melody != '2e')
```

This might seem *less* intuitive!
However, this approach can be very useful when working with actual humdrumR datasets.
In many humdrum datasets, pickup measures are indicated by have barlines labeled `=0` or `=-`.
When `r hm` reads a file, it counts the barlines and creates a field called `Bar`, and it numbers pickup measures as zero (or negative numbers, if there are more than one).
This means pickups will have `Bar < 1`.
So, in our Bach chorales:

```{r}

within(chorales, timeline(Token, pickup = Bar == 1))


```

Now the `0` in our timelines corresponds to the first downbeat of each spine, in each file.
The key advantage is that this will work even if different pieces in the corpus have pickups of different lengths, even if there is *no* pickup.

### Timestamp

The `timestamp()` function is a special variant of `timeline()` which outputs a timeline in clock-time, using the `dur()` format.
In order to do this `timestamp()` needs to know a tempo: by default, `with()` and `within()` will pass the `BPM` field from humdrum data (if there is one) to `timestamp()`.
If the `BPM` argument is not provided, the default is 60BPM.



# Counting Beats

Ok, the `timeline()` gives us a timeline in whole-note units, giving fractional (decimal) output.
Often in music, we want to know how many *beats* have ellapsed at a given time, rather than the exact time position.
For this, use the `count()`, and its `beat` argument.
The default `beat` is a whole-note, so `count()` will count which whole note you are on:

```{r}

count(row)

```

Let's try quarter-notes instead:

```{r}

count(row, beat = '4')

```

`count()` will even work for irregular beat patterns, which must be entered as a list.
For example, the meter 7/8 is often played as three beats, with the last beat being longer than the first two: a pattern line `4 4 4.`.
`count()` can count these irregular beats!

```{r}

seven8 <- c('4', '4', '8','8','8','4','4','4','8','4','4','8','8', '8', '4')

count(seven8, beat = list(c('4', '4', '4.')))


```

This could be handy for counting subdivisions in swing time!


### Subposition

The counterpart to `count()` is `subpos()`.
When we count beats, some notes don't actually land *on* the beat, but somewhere "inside" the beat---in other words, between beats.
`subpos()` will tell us how far from the beat each attack is; the unit will be whole-notes, unless
we pass a `scale` argument to change the scale.
Let's look at our last few examples again, but using `subpos()`:


```{r}

subpos(row, scale = 12)

subpos(row, beat = '4', scale = 12)

subpos(seven8, beat = list(c('4', '4', '4.')), scale = 8)


```
