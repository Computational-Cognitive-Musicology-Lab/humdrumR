Welcome to "`r Hm` data fields"!
This article explains how `r hm` encodes different pieces of musical data in the "fields" of a R data.frame.
Understanding data fields is essential to making effective use of `r hm`.

This article, like all of our articles, closely parallels information in `r hm`'s detailed code documentation, which can be found in the "[Reference](https://humdrumr.ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/reference/index.html#reading-and-writing "HumdrumR function reference, Reading and Writing")" section of the `r hm` [homepage](humdrumR.ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu).
You can also find this information within R, once `r hm` is loaded, using `?fields` or `?withinHumdrum`.

# The HumdrumR Data Model

`r Hm` bridges with *data* world of [humdrum](www.humdrum.org) with the *coding and analysis* world of R.
It does this by mapping between the [humdrum data syntax](https://humdrum.org) and a R *data.frame*.

![](images/DataModelDiagram.png){width=600px}

To fully understand any of this, you should start with at least a basic understanding of the humdrum syntax! 
Read about the syntax at [humdrum.org](humdrum.org) or check out [our article](HumdrumSyntax.html "The Humdrum Syntax") on the topic.

This article only covers how `r hm` handles basic, common humdrum syntax.
The humdrum syntax includes a few more complex structures---*spine paths* and *multi-stops* (a.k.a., sub-tokens)---which are discussed in our [Complex humdrum syntax](ComplexSyntax.html "Complex humdrum syntax article") article.

## data.frames

Data.frames are the heart and soul of R.
A data.frame is simply a two-dimensional table of named columns.
Each column is a vector of values, all of which are the same length.

In `r hm`, every single token in a collection of humdrum-syntax text files is given its own *row* in a data.frame,
which we call the "**humdrum table**."
For example, consider this simple, humdrum-syntax file:


```{r echo=FALSE, results='none'}

ex1 <- readLines('examples/BasicExample.krn')

rest <- ex1[-1]
tokens <- c(ex1[1], unlist(strsplit(rest, split = '\t| ')))

##
ex1df <- as.data.frame(t(stringi::stri_list2matrix(strsplit(rest, '\t'))), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

cat(' ', sep = '', ex1[1], '\n')
apply(format.data.frame(ex1df, justify = 'left', width = 30), 1, 
      function(x) cat(' ', x, sep = '', '\n')) 


```

This file contains `r humdrumR:::num2print(length(tokens))` individual tokens.
To illustrate, here I'll print the same file, but with *each* token bracketed by `<` and `>`:

```{r echo = FALSE}

printquoted <- function(ex) {
quoted <- ex
    quoted[] <- lapply(quoted,
                   function(col) {
                       col <- strsplit(col, split = ' ')
                       col <- lapply(col,  function(x) paste0('<', x, '>'))
                       sapply(col, paste, collapse = ' ')
                       
                   })


cat('<', ex1[1], '>', '\n', sep ='')
apply(format.data.frame(quoted, justify = 'left', width = 30), 1, 
      function(x) cat(x, sep = '', '\n'))
    invisible(NULL)
}

printquoted(ex1df)

```

So what happens when `r hm` reads this file?
(This file is bundled with `r hm` in the `"humdrumRroot/examples"` directory; See the [Getting started](GettingStarted.html "Getting started with humdrumR article") article for an explanation.)

```{r}

example1 <- readHumdrum(humdrumRroot, 'examples/BasicExample.krn')

example1
```

We see the same thing we saw earlier, when we were reading real humdrum data from the `"HumdrumData"` folder.
But what's under the hood?
We can tell `r hm` that we'd like to see the underlying **humdrum table** by explicitly printing the data, and setting `view = "table"`.
Compare the difference between these two commands:


```{r}

example1 |> print(view = "humdrum")

example1 |> print(view = "table")

```


When we use `view = "humdrum"`, we see the default `r hm` view of the data in humdrum syntax.
However, with `view = "table"`, we are show the underling humdrum table.
We can see that there is one row for *each and every* token, with different columns indicating which `File`, `Spine`, and `Record` each token comes from.
In `r hm`, we refer to the columns of the humdrum table as **fields**.

---

If you get tired of explicitly using `print()`, you can change `humdrumR`'s default print method using the 
`humdrum()` *function*, the first argument of which is `view`.


```{r}
humdrumR("data.frame")

example1

humdrumR("humdrum")

example1

```



## HumdrumR fields

Let's take a look at our humdrum table again.
To avoid typing `print(view = "table")` over an over, let's set the default `view` option to `table` (see the previous paragraph).


```{r}
humdrumR(view = "table")

example1 
```

We see four fields in the table: `Piece`, `Spine`, `Record`, and `Token`.

+ `Token` is the primary data field in all `r hm` data, containing the actual data tokens that originated in the humdrum data files your read.
  You'll see lots and lots of references to `Token` throughout these articles, and in the `r hm` [documentation](https://humdrumr.ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/reference/index.html "HumdrumR function reference")!
+ `Piece`, `Spine`, and `Record` are "structural fields," indicating where each data token is located in the humdrum syntax.

These four fields are just the tip of the iceberg!
`r Hm` datasets will generally have many more fields---you can see them all listed by using `fields()` commands:

```{r}
fields(example1)

```

We see that there are `r humdrumR:::num2print(length(example1))` fields (columns), and that they are divided into five types of fields: 

+ Data fields
+ Structure fields
+ Interpretation fields
+ Form fields
+ Reference fields

If you want a detailed explanation of what all these fields are, read the [humdrum table documentation](refrence/humTable.html "Humdrum table documentation"), which you can always get by calling `?humTable`.

### Selecting fields

What if we want to see some of these other fields?
We can use the `select()` command to pick which fields we view:

```{r}

example1 |> select(Token, Spine, Key, Bar)

```

We can also see all fields of a particular type, by specifying one of the types that the `fields()` function 
showed us: for example, `"Data"`, `"Structure"`, or `"Reference"`.

```{r}
example1 |> select('Structure')

```

We can also use [tidyverse select](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html "dyplr select article") shortcuts, for example, `everything()`:

```{r}
example1 |> select(everything())

```



If you call `select()` with no arguments, the `Token` field will be selected.
The `Token` field is always the starting point of `r hm` analysis, so it is helpful to be able to "reset" by going back to `Token`.


---

We can also view all of our fields in the default, humdrum view.

```{r}
humdrumR(view = "humdrum")

example1 |> select(Token, Key)

```

In the humdrum view, all the selected fields are pasted together (from left to right).
Don't worry, the fields are still separate in the humdrum table, they are just printed this way!
Viewing multiple fields in humdrum syntax view can be quite helpful for a small number of fields, but not so much if you are looking at more than 2--3 fields.
If you want to look at lots of fields at once set `humdrumR(view = "table")`.



### Accessing fields

Sometimes, we might want to just pull fields out of the `r hm` data table, turning them into "plain" R data.
The best way to do this is with the `pull()` function.

```{r}
example1 |> pull(Token)

example1 |> pull(Key)

```

We can also pull fields using the `$` operator: 

```{r}

example1$Token

example1$Key

```

---

If you want to pull more than once field, use `pull_data.frame()`:

```{r}

example1 |> pull_data.frame(Token, Key)

```

You get a "normal" R data.frame!
(There is also `pull_tibble()` and `pull_data.table()`, if you prefer those packages.)
You could even pull the entire humdrum table if you really want to work in "normal" R:

```{r}

example1 |> pull_data.frame(everything())

```


# Working with Fields

So we have a bunch of "fields"---how to we work with them?
One option is to "pull" the fields we want out---as explained above in the [accessing fields](DataFields.html#accessing-fields "Getting started with humdrumR article; accessing fields section") sections above---and then work with them like any normal R data structures.
However, `r hm` has a number of useful features that only available when we keep our data wrapped up in the `humdrumR` data object.
Instead, we can access and manipulate our fields directly within the humdrum table.

In the following sections, we'll use our `chorales` data again, as we did in our [Getting started with humdrumR](GettingStarted.html "Getting started with humdrumR article") article.

```{r}
readHumdrum(humdrumRroot, 'HumdrumData/BachChorales/chor0') -> chorales

```

### Humdrum style

In our [quick start](GettingStarted.html#quick-start "Getting started with humdrumR article"), we showed you the simplest and most intuitive way to manipulate `r hm` data: simply pipe data directly to any `r hm` function.

```{r}
chorales |> 
  pitch(simple = TRUE) 

```


We call this "humdrum style," because it looks a lot like the way the original [humdrum toolkit](www.humdrum.org "Humdrum main page") works.

---

As we learned in the previous example, there are a bunch of fields in our `chorales` object:

```{r}
fields(chorales)

```

So when we write something like `chorales |> pitch()`, how does the `pitch()` function know which field to work on?
It is applied to the first **selected** field, which we learned about [above](DataFields.html#selecting-fields "Getting started with humdrumR article; selecting fields section").
By default, this is the `Token` field, which is what we want!


#### New fields

Notice that, when we run `chorales |> pitch()`, the printout tells us there are two data fields: the original `Token` and a *new* `Pitch` field!
That new `Pitch` field can be view/accessed/manipulated just like any other field!
Any new field is automatically selected, so you can continue the pipe:

```{r}
chorales |> 
  pitch(simple = TRUE) |>
  tally()

```

The `pitch()` function creates a new `Pitch` field, and selects it; the `tally()` function is then applied to the `Pitch` field!

---

When a new field is created, it can immediately by piped to a subsequent command (as we just saw) but it isn't actually *saved* in or data object unless we explicitly assign the result to a variable.
In many cases we'll want to assign back to the same variable, like so:

```{r}
chorales |> 
  pitch(simple = TRUE) -> chorales

```

We can now, select, access, or manipulate the new `Pitch` field:

```{r}
chorales$Pitch

chorales |> select(Pitch, Token, Key) |> print(view = "table")

chorales |> select(Pitch)


```


#### Another new field

So we added a `Pitch` field to our `chorales` data---what if we also wanted a rhythm field?
Be careful! After our last command, the `Pitch` field is currently selected.
If we apply a [rhythm function](RhythmAndMeter.html "Rhythm and Meter in humdrumR article") now, it won't work because the `Pitch` field has no rhythm information in it.
We need to "reset" by selecting the `Token` field again.


```{r}
chorales |>
  select() |>  # this will select Token!
  duration() -> chorales
  

chorales

```

Once you start creating many fields, it can be easy to lose track of which field is selected, which can lead to common errors!

#### Multiple fields

Once we get to have more than one field to work with, it gets garder to use the "humdrum style."
Most `r hm` function wills only pipe the *first* selected field, so it doesn't matter if you select multiple fields.
However, the `tally()` function can accept multiple fields.
Now that we've created a `Pitch` *and* `Duration` fields, we can do stuff like:

```{r}
chorales |> 
  select(Pitch, Duration) |>
  tally() 

```


### Tidyverse style

The "humdrum style" from the previous section is a wonderful place to start, but it has a few limitations.
The main one is **it only works with `r hm` functions**.
If you try to use base-R function like `chorales |> mean()` or a tidyverse function like `chorales |> map()`, you'll get an error.
What's more, the humdrum style is limited in the complexity of commands you can execute.

To get beyond these limitations, we can instead use functions ("verbs") from the tidyverse [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html "Dyplr Get Started page") package: `mutate()`, `summarize()`, and `reframe()`.
In a call to these functions, you can freely and access and manipulate any field of your humdrumR data.
For example:



```{r}

chorales |>
  mutate(mint(Token))


```

What happened here?

1. The call `mint(Token, simple = TRUE)` is evaluated, using the `Token` field from "inside" the `chorales` data object.
2. The resulting data ([melodic intervals](reference/int.html "Mint documentation")) is put into a new field, which it calls `mint(Token)`.

Of course, `mint()` is a `r hm` function, so we could do this simple command without using `mutate()`, by calling `chorales |> mint()` in "humdrum style."
However, by using `mutate()` we can do a few nifty things.
For one, we can execute more complex commands involving any of our fields:

```{r}

chorales |>
  mutate(ifelse(Duration > (1/8), 
                mint(Token), 
                "NA"))


```


---

We can use non-`r hm` functions, like `gsub()`, `nchar()`, or `mean()`:

```{r}

chorales |>
  mutate(gsub('-', 'b', Token))

chorales |>
  summarize(Token |> nchar() |> mean())

```


---

We can choose the names for our new field(s):

```{r}

chorales |>
  mutate(MelodicIntervals = ifelse(Duration > (1/8), 
                mint(Token), 
                "NA"))
```

---

We can make more than one field at once:

```{r}
chorales |>
  mutate(MelodicIntervals = ifelse(Duration > (1/8), 
                mint(Token), 
                "NA"),
         MetricPosition = metsubpos(Token))


```

## Base-R style (With and Within)

In addition to the tidyverse "verbs" `mutate()` and `summarize()`, `r hm` also defines methods of the base-R functions `with` and `within()`.
These functions work a lot like `mutate()` and `summarize()`, but are more flexible (see [?withHumdrum](reference/withinHumdrum.html "withinHumdrum documentation page") for details).
The `with()` function is particularly useful, as using it is basically like going `mutate() |> pull()` in one step.
You will see `with()` and `within()` used in many articles!

## Why work within humdrumR table?

You might be wondering, especially if you already a strong R user, why not just [pull](DataFields.html#accessing-fields "Getting started with humdrumR article; accessing fields section") the data fields out of the `r hm` data and use "normal" base-R, or perhaps tidyverse functions.
You certainly can do that!
However, `r hm` offers a number of special features that make it particularly useful for musicological analysis of humdrum data.

### Humdrum syntax

An obvious example, is that as long as your data is in `r hm` data object, you have the option of viewing the data in its humdrum-syntax form.
This allows you to "see" where things are happening in the original data/score, which maintains a transparency that affords good research.
You can also generate new humdrum syntax data, and [write](ReadWrite.html "Reading and writing humdrum data") it to new humdrum-syntax files.


### Isolating data tokens

By default, `r Hm` commands only operate on humdrum *data* tokens, ignoring bar lines, intepretations, and null data tokens.
You can override this by providing a `dataTypes` argument to most `r hm` functions.
For example, compare these two commands:

```{r}

chorales |>
  mutate(Nchar = nchar(Token))

chorales |> 
  mutate(Nchar = nchar(Token), dataTypes= 'GLIMDd')

```



If you pull your data out of `r hm`, you'll have to manually manage what data types you want to work with yourself.

### Automatic field arguments

For some functions, `r hm` will automatically pass specific fields as arguments to functions you call.
For example, `r hm` [pitch functions](references/pitchFunctions.html "HumdrumR pitch functions") like `solfa()` (solfege) need to key information to get you the information you want.
Many humdrum data sets will have a `Key` field, which is automatically created if you read data files containing key interpretations, like `G*:`.
`r Hm` unless you explicitly override it with a different `Key` argument, `r hm` will automatically pass the `Key` argument to pitch functions.
Thus:

```{r}

identical(chorales |> mutate(Solfa = solfa(Token)), 
          chorales |> mutate(Solfa = solfa(Token, Key = Key)))

```

Many `r hm` functions are automatically passed the `Exclusive` field, to help them decide how to parse data.
Other examples of "automatic arguments" include functions like `metlev()`, which is automatically called as `metlev(meter = TimeSignature)` if a `TimeSignature` field is defined.
Function documentation will always tell you about any automatic arguments: for example, see `?solfa` or `?metlev`.

### Automatic musical boundaries

A special case of "automatic arguments" (see previous section) is "lagged" functions, like `mint()`, `ditto()`, and `lag()`.
These functions work by shifting of "lagging" the contents of a field.
The `groupby` argument is used to make data is shifted across inappropriate boundaries in the music/data.
For example, we don't want the first note from the second spine of data to be shifted into the last note of the first spine.
What his all means that the following commands will all, automatically, respect logical (melodic) grouping boundaries in the data:


```{r}

chorales |> mutate(ditto(Token))

chorales |> mint()

chorales |> mutate(lag(Token))

```



### Special syntactic "sugar"

`r Hm` also provides some additional "syntatic" sugar features.
The simplest example is the `.` variable, which will be automatically replaced with first selected field when using tidyverse-style function.
This is helpful when in pipes where you might lose track of what the selected field is called.
For example, in the command

```{r}

chorales |>
  select(Token) |> 
  mutate(lilypond(., simple = TRUE, generic = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(ifelse(. == 'e', 'X', Token))


```

the first `mutate()` call creates a field called `lilypond(Token, simple = TRUE, generic = TRUE)`, but we don't have to type this out: we can just type `.`.

---

All of `r hm`'s syntactic tricks are fully explained elsewhere, including in the [?withinHumdrum](reference/withinHumdrum.html "Within humdrum data") documentation.
