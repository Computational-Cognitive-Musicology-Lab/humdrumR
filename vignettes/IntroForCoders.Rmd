```{r, include = FALSE}

This document is tutorial/introduction for the `r hm` package aimed at experienced programmers/coders.
It moves along relatively quickly and uses more technical programming jargon.
If you are looking for something easier and less technical, check out (Getting started with humdrumR)[GettingStarted.html "Getting started with humdrumR"] instead.
This tutorial assumes you understand many major principles of coding, but not necessarily that you are experienced coding in R specifically---thus, we *will* take time to introduce an explain some R-specific syntax and philosophies.
