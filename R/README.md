# Code Style

## Assignment

The `<-` assignment operator should be used for all assignments.

```
#BAD

x = 5

mean(x) -> z

#GOOD

x <- 5

z <- mean(x)

```

---------

`=` is used for naming function arguments, including naming elements of lists or vectors.

```
#BAD

mean = 5


#GOOD

dnorm(x, mean = 5)

list(mean = 5, sd = 2)


```


## Space

All operators should be surrounded by spaces:

```
#BAD

x<-2

2+2

4<x

#GOOD

x <- 2

2 + 2

4 < x

```

Commas should be followed by spaces, but NOT preceded by a space.

```
#BAD

c(x,y,z)

c(x , y , z)

#GOOD

c(x, y, z)


```




## Braces

An opening curly brace should NEVER go on its own line and should always be followed by a new line.
A closing curly brace should always go on its own line, unless itâ€™s followed by else.

```

if (TRUE) {
	# do this
} 

if (TRUE) {
	# do this
} else {
	# else do this
}

for (i in 1:10) {
	# do this
}


```

## If 

If the true or false blocks consist of single short expressions, write the whole thing on one line:

```
if (is.null(x)) x <- 3

if (is.null(x)) x <- else y <- x


```

Otherwise write out the whole thing 

```
if (TRUE) {
	# do this
} 

if (TRUE) {
	# do this
} else {
	# else do this
}

```

## Blocks as Expression

In R, everything is an expression, which returns a result.
A block of code---`{ # stuff in here}`---is itself an expression!
The "result" of the expression is the last result:

```
{
	2 + 2
	3 + 2
	1 - 0
} # result is 0

```

In general, code should be written so that blocks are simply evalulate to a single value---in other words, each block should serve *one* purpose.
Side effects, should be avoided, but are sometimes necessary.


--------------------

In many case an if block is used to assign alternate values to the same variable.
The result of the if block should be assigned, rather than assigning the variable separately in each block:

```
# BAD:
if (TRUE) {
	x <- # complex expression
} else {
	x <- # another expression
}	

# GOOD:

x <- if(TRUE) {
	# complex expression
} else {
	# another expression
}


```


Short if blocks should also be used as function arguments in place:

```
# BADISH

mean <- if (###) 0 else mean(x)


dnorm(x, mean)

# BETTER

dnorm(x, if (###) 0 else mean(x))


```
