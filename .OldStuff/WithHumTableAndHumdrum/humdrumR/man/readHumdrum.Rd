\title{Read humdrum files into R}
\usage{
readHumdrum(pattern, ..., regex = FALSE, recursive = FALSE,
  validate = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{Chracter: Each directory (separated by '/') and the final pattern are treated as regular expressions.}

\item{recursive}{Logical: Should each search term (directories, and files) be searched for recursively through all sub directories? 
\code{recursive = TRUE} should only be used with a simple search pattern.}

\item{validate}{Logical: Should each humdrum file be validated using the function \code{\link{humdrumValidate}}?}
}
\description{
This function reads one or more humdrum files into a humdrumR "humdrum.table" object.
}
\examples{
readHumdrum('*krn$') # loads all files ending with 'krn' in the currect directory

## UNIX style---no regexes
readHumdrum('Composers/Be*/*/Joined/*krn') 
# Goes inside the directory "Composers."
# Inside "Composers" looks for directories that start with "Be".
# If there are any "Be*" matching directories within "Composers" matches all directories within them.
# Within these directories, looks for directories called "Joined."
# If there are any directories that match "Joined$", loads all files (if any) that end with "krn."


## with regexes---notice the use of ^ and $ to make sure we get exact matches
#' readHumdrum('^Composers$/^Be|^Mo/.*/^Joined$/.*krn$') 
# Goes inside the directory "Composers."
# Inside "Composers" looks for directories that start with "Be" or "Mo".
# If there are any "Be|Mo" matching directories within "Composers" matches all directories within them.
# Within these directories, looks for directories called "Joined."
# If there are any directories called "Joined", loads all files (if any) that end with "krn".
