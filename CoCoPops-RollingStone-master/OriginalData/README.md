In the original release of the Rolling Stone Corpus, de Clercq and Temperley encoded their transcriptions in a novel, non-standardized, encoding scheme.
The dataset includes, for each of the two hundred songs, two harmonic transcriptions (one by each author; `.txt` files) and one melodic transcription (by one or the other author; `.mel` files) are encoded in three separate text files.
In addition, timestamp information (timestamps for each downbeat in the recording) are also encoded in a separate file (`.tim` files).
This puts the data into four separate files in the `OriginalData` directory.

Later, Tan, Lustig, and Temperley (2019) annotated the lyrics, including syllable stress estimates, for a subset of 80 of the 200 tracks.
This data is encoded in 80 `.str` files in the `OriginalData` directory.
